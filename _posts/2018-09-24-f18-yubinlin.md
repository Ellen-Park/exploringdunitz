  In March 13th 1967, just after midnight, bar manager Kitty Genovese was walking to her apartment in New York City from a long night’s work. Suddenly she was stabbed from the back with a hunting knife. Under excruciating pain, she screamed: “Oh my God, He stabbed me, Help me!” The attacker ran away and Kitty struggled to move towards the apartment. After ten minutes, the attacker returned, stabbing Kitty Genovese, who was barely conscious and lying on the in a hallway, to death. More than 30 neighbors witnessed the murder, but no one was willing to help her before the killer returns. This case shocked the society and sparked the discussion about the apathy of life in big cities. Los Angeles surely qualifies to the list of big cities, and consequently falls into the stereotype from the murder case. The most representative part of Los Angeles belongs to its downtown area, thus appropriate for the examination of the environment and interpersonal connection. Downtown Los Angeles is an area with diverse culture amplified from murals and its demographic, but lacks interpersonal connections due to hostile architectures involved in gentrification plan. The diversity of residents as well as the advanced transportation network flourished downtown Los Angeles in both culture and finance, differing from average counties in the United States. Although lacking accessibility, murals in this area combine unique cultural heritage from these residents and give them a sense of proud, but these murals are often considered as stereotypes and covered with graffities as signs of protest. The income level divides the residents in downtown Los Angeles, thus generating a plan for gentrification, creating hostile architectures and guarded interpersonal connection in the downtown.
  As the center of a metropolis, downtown Los Angeles is nourished by its rich history and deep industrial foundations. First established in 1781 by Felipe de Neve from Spain, Los Angeles was first occupied by forty-four original settlers know as Los Angeles Pobladores. This colony was soon merged into New Spain’s territory, and then transferred to Mexico. After more than two centuries, Los Angeles still preserves some characteristics from its earliest residents as well as these , which is reflected on the demographic data and census. According to the 2010 US census data, around half of the population in Downtown Los Angeles is Hispanic or Latino (“US Census Bureau QuickFacts: Los”). For comparison, the national average of Latino population is around 16% (Ennis). This relatively large group of Hispanic residents in this area constructs the rich Mexican culture in downtown Los Angeles. The proximity between Los Angeles and Mexico explains the large portion of Hispanic residents in downtown. In addition, the costal location of Los Angeles becomes the first stop for other immigrants to pursue their American dream from cross the Pacific Ocean. The first wave of Chinese immigrants began in the mid-1850s – as servants. Chinatown formed as these immigrants accumulates over times, adding traditional Chinese culture such as acupuncture, herb medicine, and Feng Shui. The similar story repeated on Japanese and Korean immigrants, cultivating Korean Town and Little Tokyo. The culture mixing in Los Angeles does not stop at Asian immigrants. During World War II 1900s, as the defense production went on overdrive, labor force, consisting mainly African Americans, moved across America to Los Angeles, devoting themselves into the production of steel, rubber and automobiles. Their community thrived in Compton – the origin of new populated Hip-Hop and Rap music (Simpson). Los Angeles melts the tradition and culture from different ethnicity and forges these into different aspects of the city.  
  The underlying motive behind immigration attributes to the rapid growth of economy in Los Angeles. During the early twentieth century, Los Angeles experienced a period a rapid development due to its production of petroleum. Versatile forms of transportation, including Santa Fe railway, Southern Pacific, and ports in Santa Monica, channeled the exportation of such product. During the World War I and II, the industrial production level skyrocketed due to Los Angeles’ proximity to Pacific War. Today, downtown Los Angeles still belongs to one of the most productive area in terms of capital, with an average of 63 billions worth of wholesales per year (“US Census Bureau QuickFacts: Los”). In addition to the pure industrial progress, Downtown Los Angeles attracted multiple financial institution, expediting the money flow and financial activities. The industrial and financial growth sparked the entertainment field. From Hollywood to Disneyland, people in Los Angeles were able to enjoy the cultural flourishment from their hard work. The symbiotic relationship between industrial and entertainment plays a critical role throughout Los Angeles’ development. Thanks to the fertile bedrock and reputation for industrial development accumulated during the past century for Los Angeles, now this area hold homes for some of the largest corporations in the world. However, the difference between Downtown Los Angeles and the typical towns in US does not limit to population and productivity.
  I spent my past four years for high school in Gwinnett – the second largest county in the state of Georgia. The overarching difference is the population density – the key factor for a city distinguished from a suburb. Gwinnett county has more than 400 squared miles with a population just short of one million. Los Angeles city only has 30 more squared miles in area compared to Gwinnett county but has close to four million population (“US Census Bureau QuickFacts: Gwinnett”). Such drastic difference in population density limits the standard of living, since the relative price of real estate rises as land becomes correspondingly more expensive. This reduction in living space is easy to see from the type of typical households in Los Angeles and Gwinnett county: apartments and condo versus ranch – style home with a front and back yard. The scarcity in living space motivates people to move out from the city and commute to work in downtown. The census indicates that while with only 35,000 residents, downtown Los Angeles experiences a daytime population over 200,000 (“US Census Bureau QuickFacts: Gwinnett”). Consequently, such large flow of population in a daily basis poses tremendous pressure for the public transportation system. Compared to the average commute time nationwide of 49 minutes, the average time in Los Angeles reaches 54 minutes, bringing Los Angeles to one of the most stressful commutes in U.S. (“Survey”). Like a filter, the distance between suburb and downtown Los Angeles separates white collar workforce with stable income and those underprivileged who cannot afford suburban housing and commuting vehicles.
  The symbiotic relationship between murals and neighborhood solidifies the unique culture of such. The diversity of population in downtown Los Angeles is the incubator for versatile form of art, typically murals. Unlike paintings or other artworks that are displayed in a climate-controlled museum, murals convey ideas in a more public fashion. From this photo I took in downtown Los Angeles, the mural highlights the famous actor: Anthony Quinn, as well as the Victor Clothing Company. Both the actor and the company has strong Hispanic background: Antony Quinn was born in Mexico and developed his career in Los Angeles, while the clients for Victor Clothing company mainly were mainly Latinos. This mural is located in on the wall of now closed Victor Clothing building on the 3rd street in Los Angeles, which is populated by Latino residents. The location of the mural corresponds with the idea expressed on the mural: to Honor Latino people and companies.

   In the article “Mainstreaming Murals”, author Judy Vannais explores the purpose behind such murals: “ (murals) celebrate ethnic identity and give popular expression and a sense of pride to marginalized inner city communities” (Vannis). With the wave of gentrification, many Latino communities lose its sense of belonging by replacing their traditional stores and restaurants with modern find dining services, and murals, shown in public, reminding other resident the cultural heritage of these ignored Latino residents. Thus the murals and the communities tie together to generate resonance for the amplification of its cultural values. However, some of the murals are not as accessible as the one shown above, gathering little attention from its viewers. 
   Despite the positive impacts of murals in the community, the accessibility to these murals is extremely limited due to physical barriers and locations for these artworks. The concept of public availability separates murals and other forms of artwork. Like a billboard, a mural radiates its meaning to the residents in that community. When I was on the metro to Pershing Square, I saw a series of murals near Pico Station. However, traveling at 40 miles per hour, I cannot see the murals until I took a photo on my phone. These murals have a central topic of city of Los Angeles as well as its landmarks and artistic values. I have only around three seconds to take this picture. From the picture, we can see that the street is completely empty, without any person or cars. In addition, it is unlikely for any passenger to see the murals clearly due to the speed of metro and most passengers are looking at their cellphones. Therefore, these murals lack the audiences they need to propagate the cultural heritage of Los Angeles. During the trip to downtown LA, another student in the team shares her inability to have the access to some buildings to take pictures of murals. Upon entering the building, a security officer stop her and denied her access to the office building due to the lack of identification documents. This human barrier limits these murals in office buildings to the people who work there, not the general public. Regardless of form of separation, a large portion of murals in downtown Los Angeles have become the playground for graffiti writers due to the lack of maintenance. 
   
Indents do not, so just put a space in for each new paragraph.

Formating is very simple in this document. 

To add an image you will use an exclamation point, then a description in brackets, and then the location of the image in parentheses. We will try to store ALL of our images in the GitHub repository.  There is also a little bit of text after the image in the special curly brackets and the word image inside it. Leave this alone! It displays the image in a special viewer so when you click on the image it opens it up in its own viewer and then you can cycle through all the images in this viewer. You can put in as many images as you like. Just always make sure to have the curly brackets afterwards.
