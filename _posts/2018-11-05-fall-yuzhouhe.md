																					All Power to the People
                                                                                                                                                                        
Staring at the soldiers in front of me, it takes a while to realize they are just a part of a mural. Time has left scratches on the mural, like glory scars on the soldiers’ solemn faces. Decades have passed after their war against injustice, but their voices are still echoing in the air and call for a better future. They were not only soldiers who protected their community with blood and weapons, but also black panthers who served black people through welfare programs. To remember their exceptional contributions to control the fate of black people in their hand, people painted the mural “To Protect and Serve” in South-Central Los Angeles to depict the changes that taken place in the neighborhood. However, the social injustice in the community was not eliminated that easily. While low income and lack of education opportunities led to many problems facing by the African American community during the 1960s and 1970s in South Los Angeles and provided opportunities for the Black Panther Party to thrived, these same demographic factors will continue to challenge the community in the future. The demographics of neighborhoods across Los Angeles differ largely. The black community in South-Central has long been characterized as a group with relatively low income, low living standard and lack of education opportunities, facing social injustice like gentrification. When their government and the police could not bring them a stable life and make their life even worse during the mid-1960s, Black Panther Party found support from the locals and helped reduce the social problems through various programs. The relationship between South-Central and the party is essential for a better understanding of the movement. Though Black Panther Party was no longer there, the spirit of Black Panthers is inherited by every member of the community. The neighborhood has been facing similar social problems for decades and based on the current demographic facts of the neighborhood, such problems are still going to influence the community. To fight against gentrification, a potential solution is to improve the education level of the residents and change the part of the demographics that haven’t fluctuated much for decades.
 
Since the formation of black people communities in South-Central centuries ago, their demographics changed frequently. However, the scale of fluctuations is similar to the overall changes happened in the whole United States, making key factors like average education received always below average. For example, the median year black people of Los Angeles in school increases from 10.4 years in 1970 to 12.3 years in 1990, while the national average also increases from 12.1 years to 12.7 years. (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1970 and 1990). The lack of education opportunities and low income led to problems like high unemployment rate, poverty, and common street crime. However, there is no large black population decline taken place in the community before 1990. In a book called "The Dark Tree", Historian Steve Isoardi mentioned four crucial factors that form the basis of those African American community in South-Central: an expanding economy and the prospect of jobs, the relatively low cost of real estate, a mild climate, and a seemingly less-overt racism (Steve Isoardi, The Dark Tree). While the expanding economy promises future improvement on the living standard of African Americans, the low living cost, comfortable climate, and the less-overt racism encouraged more African Americans to move to here. 
 
Between the mid-1960s and mid-1970s, the primary challenge met by the community was increased racial discrimination. The decade is special because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned all discrimination of any kind in workplace, voting, public places. While the act was made for the welfare of those minorities, the interest of some white people is impaired, and they treat the black people with expanding rights with more hostility. The hostility then evolves into violent conflictions between the white police and black citizens, commonly known as police brutality. To respond to cases of police brutality, several riots have taken place in South Los Angeles, such as the Watts Riots of 1965, which results in over 1,000 injuries and over $40 million property loss (Watts Rebellion). Instead of direct armed confrontations with the police, Black Panther Party used more legitimate alternatives to protest social injustice, like armed neighborhood patrol.

The Black Panther Party revolution took place between the mid-1960 and mid-1970, and they attempted to solve issues like poverty, inadequate health care and the lack of education opportunities. Founded in 1966 by Bobby Seale and Huey Newton, their initial goal is to protest against American imperialism through armed neighborhood patrol. After Huey Newton was imprisoned in Oakland for killing a police officer in self-defense, the organization spreads to Los Angeles to gather more supports to free Newton. As the party grew, they started to provide various benefit to local black people communities, like the Breakfast for Children program that provides free breakfast to kids, the Black Panther Newspaper program that spreads the ideology of Black Panthers and a Medical Clinic Program that offers free health care services (Chiles, Nick). The main purpose of those programs is to bring land, bread, housing, education, clothing, justice and peace to black people (Ten-Point Program). On one hand, those programs helped to improve the living standard of the neighborhoods and strengthen the power of the black community; on the other hand, the Black Panthers gained supports from the neighborhoods to continue their mission.

Though the Black Panther Party was gradually disintegrated around the mid of 1970s dues to both the pressure from police and the loss of valuable members, their efforts are remembered. On 3406 11th Avenue of South-Central, on the wall of a hair salon, a mural called “To Protect and Serve” is painted by Noni Olabisi in the year 1992 to memorize great contributions of Black Panther Party in their fight for social justice and the welfare of black people. It is a huge mural depicting Black Panther Party members, police officers, the government and local people.

   The mural can be divided into three parts. In the middle part of the mural is the Black Panther Party members. Notably, Noni uses characters of different sexes and ages to reflect the diversity of Black Panther Party.  Kids, men, women, and old people all fight together to fulfill their final goal ——“All power to the people.” Some members are carrying guns, which reflects their armed neighborhood patrol program. On the left, there are a blind judge, aggressive police officers and local people in struggle. The blind judge refers to the decision to imprison Huey Newton, and the two police officers dragging the black man reflects police brutality at that time. This part corresponds to the seventh point of the ten-point program of Black Panther Party: “We want an immediate end to police brutality and murder of black people!” (ten-point program) The right side of the mural portrays programs Black Panther created. There are tags of “free food program” on the food bags, and newspapers made by Black Panthers at the bottom right corner. The satisfaction seen on people’s face at the right side forms a dramatic contrast with the desperation of people at the left side. By juxtaposing them, the artist highlights the outcome of the Black Panther Movement.
   
   Through the depiction of Black Panther Party, the mural sends an important message that the future of the black people community depends on black people themselves. In common sense, the policeman represents the justice, but in Noni’s mural, they represent the brutality upon the black. The completion of the mural met many obstacles from the government. According to his conference notes, Noni’s idea of choosing the Black Panther Party as the mural topic was rejected twice by the committee. Not until the third conference when he received supports from black communities that the committee allows him to paint the mural under certain censorships.  In one of his conference notes, he wrote down some common opposite opinions, including committee’s negative impressions on Black Panthers and concerns on putting violent elements on the mural. None of those objections stops Noni from painting this mural. Instead, they showed the importance of painting a mural of Black Panthers. Many people, like the committee members in the conference, still regarded Black Panthers sorely as criminals who brought chaos to the society. As a result, the presence of the mural will be helpful in representing the actual historical facts and making Black Panther Members positive figures. Furthermore, the creation of the mural reminds people of the effort their ancestors made to improve the life of black people. It is not only about Black Panthers and South-Central. The mural calls new generations to protect their communities and serve the neighborhoods when they are in needs. Noni wants to tell people instead of waiting for the government to make their life better, people can also achieve that through their own efforts. Those efforts do not need to be violent, and the actions of the Black Panther Party are the best examples. Figure 2: Sentence from Noni’s conference notes

   In 2018, the South-Central community is still characterized as a group with low income and lack of education opportunities, which suggests that some of the underlying social challenges the communities have faced will continue to influence them. The average per capita income of South-Central households is only one-fifth of the average per capita income of the United States, with 31.1% of the people below poverty line (13.4% for the whole United States).  Only about 50.9% of people in South Central has a high school or higher education, while the value is 88% for the whole United States (U.S. Census Bureau 2017). Moreover, South-Central is regarded as one of the most crowded communities in the United States according to census data (Barragan, Bianca), leading to the scarcity of the educational resources and employment opportunities. More efforts are required to bring the community out of the cycle of poverty. The low income cannot afford those neighborhoods expensive higher education opportunities, and the lack of higher education, in turn, restricts the households from high salary jobs and lucrative business opportunities. 
   
   As the severest challenge faced by the South-Central African American community, Gentrification is devouring the local neighborhoods, turning their resistance in vain. Generally, gentrification improves the material quality of an area and renovates the old neighborhood, usually through a relocation of established residents and businesses, which is known as a demographic shift. It may not be a good thing, because old neighborhoods are displaced for new ones to move in. Gentrification has been happening all the time, but in the recent decade, the tide of gentrification becomes much stronger, shown by a huge increase in living cost. Take house price as an example. Over the last year, the house price in South Los Angeles has gone up by 10.2% (Zillow). About 80% of the South-Central neighborhoods are renters. The significant increment in housing price every year will either cause homelessness or substandard housing. In the year 2015 only, the number of homelessness in South-Central has experienced a 44% increase (Woocher, Jacob). One cause of such a change is the expansion of the University of Southern California, which turned buildings at 1100 Exposition Boulevard into student housing and displaced all the original neighborhoods living there (Capital & Main). Laws do not ban landlords from terminating their monthly rental contracts with the local. As more and more institutions choose to move into South-Central due to its convenient location for transportation, a substantial black population decline in South-Central is inevitable. Currently, most of the African Americans spend more than 30% of their income on rentals, and the burden on them will only become heavier as the city develops (Woocher, Jacob). The first consequence of gentrification is that it weakens the influence of black people through the displacement of the current neighborhood, as less black voice will be heard in the South-Central. South-Central neighborhoods have fought against gentrification very hard throughout the past decades in order to maintain its current demographics. However, the increasing eviction upon the South-Central renters provided much more pressure upon their resistance. It will be even harder for them to protest against social injustice in the future. Secondly, when gentrification pushes those black communities away from South-Central, it also pushes those communities away from the economic centers. The displacement will only trap those African Americans more rooted in the poverty cycle, making the job and education opportunities more scare. Moreover, those neighborhoods are going to experience physical and mental problems, since they have moved away from where they have been living for centuries. Most black people lived together in South-Central will offer each other help, similar to behaviors in community economics. Evictions upon them will move them away from their past social cycle and make their life less secured.
While there are many bad consequences associated with gentrifications, the actions of the neighborhoods are important in preventing further impacts. There are many things we can learn from the Black Panther Party and apply to the current neighborhood. The most effective way to break the poverty cycle is through the provision of educations. When an area has more education opportunities, the average education received by the neighborhoods will increase, hence provides them better employment opportunities with arising income. Realizing the importance of education upon reducing discriminations, Black Panthers provided free education to local children. However, different from discrimination, gentrification is a social injustice that was not banned by laws and ignored by many people. Just like few students studying in USC know the exposition park eviction and the impact of the expansion of their university, middle-class families do not realize the fact that capital market has made hundreds of people in South-Central homeless. Many people regarded the operation of the capital market as the rule of society, without knowing struggles faced by the poor. For now, few things can be done to change the capitalism behavior of the society without making the society more chaotic. However, education grants the residents more competitiveness in the labor market, which in turn improve their lives. For local South-Central residents, their war against gentrification is going to be alone for a long time, before more people realize how huge will the impact of gentrification be. Like the choices of Black Panthers, they must depend on themselves for now and strengthen the black power using education as the most powerful weapon against social injustice.
   
   The impacts of gentrification brought to South-Central black communities during the last decade is just a beginning, and more challenges are waiting for them. Community with higher income will continue their expansions, leaving fewer places for the low-income locals. By identifying the key demographic facts of the neighborhood in the analysis above, we can arrive at a potential solution: improve their competitiveness in the capitalized market through the provision of more education opportunities. Though the battle against gentrification should be led by themselves, if they can receive assistance from the government and other institutions, their efforts will achieve even a better outcome than the feat of Black Panther Party movement. Five decades ago, Black Panthers wrote in their ten-point program “All want is land, bread, housing, education, clothing, justice, and peace.” The victims of gentrification are asking for the same. Though there are few fluctuations in the relative demographics of the South-Central neighborhood and social injustice continues, the Black Panthers reminds local residents of the importance of every neighborhood’s role in the battle against gentrification. The initiation of Black Panther Party movement is not a coincidence, and more Black Panthers will stand out to control the fate of their own community in the future. Looking at the mural for the last time upon leaving, the red background glows in my eyes like the blood of revolution. In the air, the voice of Black Panthers becomes more and more clear: 
   
   “All Power to the People!”
