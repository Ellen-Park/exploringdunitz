18 years, 11 months, 12 days and counting, I’ve lived in Santa Monica; born and raised in the city, I felt like I had a solid understanding of what the city is “about”. When afforded the opportunity to conduct a research project on one of USC’s neighboring districts, however, I couldn’t help but choose to research Santa Monica even further, if only for the sole reason that it’s the only place I’ve ever called home. In the ensuing weeks following this research project’s initiation date, residents have been interviewed, pictures have been captured, art has been inspected, hypotheses have been formed, data has been analyzed, hypotheses have been restructured, I have learned. The research that’s been conducted all leads to an unmistakable conclusion: Santa Monica is a liberal tech and business hub that sports a future-oriented mindset designed in a manner that demonstrates that the city cares for its people. Conversations and surveys with/of neighbors confirm that the city is liberal; analysis of expert reviews on the business climate of Santa Monica as well as first-hand analysis of local businesses demonstrate that Santa Monica is a booming business destination; examination of local initiatives illustrate the level of caring the city has for its people. In the following paragraphs, the aforementioned data will be discussed in greater detail.



Locals are quite open-minded when it comes to policy making and various controversial topics. Instead of relying on the already solid understanding of the type of people who reside in the city, however, I opted to get my hands dirty and further investigate Santa Monica’s residents; I compiled a short list of several rather controversial yet deciding questions into a Google Forms, and set out to the streets to survey my Santa Monican neighbors. The questionnaire started out with a very simplistic question asking the participant to self-assess him/herself; the question read: “Do you consider yourself a liberal?” Of the 66 people surveyed, an overwhelming 48 of them (72.7%) did in fact consider themselves to be liberals. Even though it may not be the case that all 48 of the participants who sided with the left side of the political spectrum for the purposes of the questionnaire are truly die-hard liberals (some may have felt peer pressure from surrounding bystanders to express themselves as liberals) it seems likely that at least the majority of the people interviewed were liberals. As alluded to earlier, however, the survey did not stop at the one simplistic question; in the two follow-up questions, participants were asked whether they supported or opposed mainstream questions oftentimes debated by the two opposing political parties. The two questions read, “Do you believe in freedom of choice in regards to abortion?” and “Are you a supporter of Gay Marriage?”. Of the 66 people answering the questions, 51 (77.3%) answered that they do believe in freedom of choice in regards to abortion and 52 (77.8%) answered that they are supporters of Gay Marriage, respectively. It seems like most political debates, at one point or another, touch upon these aforementioned topic; invariably, left supporters lean towards supporting freedom of choice and Gay Marriage, while rightists oppose them. Although a survey of 66 residents in a city of 92,298 people is a relatively small sample size, it’s clear that if the rest of Santa Monica’s populace exhibits somewhat similar views to those of the surveyed, then it’s safe to say that the residents are liberal. With the adult residents being accounted for as liberal, the examination of liberal ideas in Santa Monica continues with evaluation of its younger populace.
As is often the case, children take on many of the qualities that their parents and community elders exhibit; Santa Monica is no different: Santa Monica kids are liberal, and growing up in such a liberal environment has given the young generation the confidence to speak their minds. Although Santa Monica high schoolers have historically been open-minded and confident, Spring 2018 brought an entirely different beast out of them. In the wake of several shootings, Santa Monica high schoolers did everything in their power to have their liberal voices be heard: they organized school rallies and campus wide “walk-outs” to allow the world to hear their cries that there’d been enough gun (MIRRORMMG) violence as it was and that it was time for the government to enforce more stringent regulations regarding gun ownership. One of Santa Monica’s local newspapers reported the story of the students collaborating to organize the aforementioned events: “Students from several local high schools met in a church hall in Santa Monica on Tuesday night to finalize plans for today’s scheduled walkouts at 10 a.m. and a rally at Santa Monica City Hall at 11 a.m. in protest of gun violence… ‘We want to be a part of this change that people are talking about,’ said Lea Yamashiro, a junior at Santa Monica High School who is in charge of publicizing the school’s walkout and protest at city hall”(Author). In a school of more than 3,000 students, to have the majority of the students collaborate, unite, and support a left backed movement (gun control), the action speaks louder than any write up of the event ever could. Simply stated, Santa Monica High School is comprised of Santa Monica resident children. With about 16% of the city’s population being comprised of kids (Census Reporter), and the majority of them supporting liberal ideals, it isn’t much of a stretch to figure that, combined with the data of from my individual research pointing towards most of the residents being left-minded, that Santa Monica is mostly comprised of liberals. Having established that Santa Monica’s residents are liberals, it is now appropriate to tackle the next portion of the paper: Santa Monica and its businesses.
Numerous established tech giants are setting their roots in Santa Monica and neighboring cities; such decisions benefit the city’s residents. In an online article from the online job placement forum, Built In Los Angeles, it’s stated that “Over the last 20 years, Santa Monica has firmly established itself as the epicenter for tech in Southern California. Home to dozens of intriguing tech startups, in addition to a number of well-established tech companies, the city isn't just the metaphorical capital of Silicon Beach: it's the genesis for the nickname that defines tech in LA ”(Siegel). This quote from Siegel illustrates the fact that Santa Monica is a business destination as well as any other. As a consequence of these well established technology companies moving to Santa Monica,  many high paying jobs are brought to the communities as well. With the likes of Snapchat and Google establishing themselves in Santa Monica/Silicon Beach, the average salaries of the people living there rise, leading to more financial liberties for its residents, thus leading to better qualities of life. An anecdotal story further illustrates the point that Santa Monica is a sought after tech and business destination. About a year and a half ago in the spring of 2017, the scooter tech start-up, Bird, established its roots in Santa Monica. Because Santa Monicans are, by comparison, rather affluent, the luxury scooter brand has been a huge success. More importantly, though, the company has brought in an influx of jobs for people who would otherwise have quite limited job alternatives. These new-found jobs give people a sense of purpose and enhance the quality of life residents are able to enjoy. Additional examples of tech start-ups uplifting the local economy are Ring (a home security company) and Blockfolio (a cryptocurrency price data watching app). With so many industry leading companies believing in Santa Monica enough to want to conduct their business there and to move their businesses there, the logical assumption is that Santa Monica is a premiere technology and business destination.
When a city is open-minded and business-minded, previously unseen business undertakings emerge within the city. Santa Monica is home to a well-known locale both locals and tourists oftenly frequent, 3rd Street Promenade. Being the epicenter of much innovation/intellectual traffic, the Promenade is home to much entrepreneurial innovation. Businesses attempt to stay ahead of the game and in doing so, figured out that it can be quite beneficial to cater to a large part of the populace: tourists. One method these forward-thinking entrepreneurs capitalize on the opportunity is to bring tourists’ home-grown tastes and preferences to the business storefronts. On various stores throughout the street, these businesses apply Japanese characters to their business names. For instance, the clothing brand, Superdry, a UK based brand that incorporates Japanese lettering into their brand in order to cater to a broader clientele. With businesses willing to step out of their comfort zones and offer previously unthought of ideas, they demonstrate that they’re serious about what they’re doing. Being based in Santa Monica, it also demonstrates Santa Monica’s willingness to support innovation to continue becoming a strong business center. Coming up in the upcoming several paragraphs, the last point of the paper will be addressed: Santa Monica’s guardianship of its people. 
Santa Monica demonstrates that it’s caring through the quality of education it provides its people. Santa Monica’s K-12 SMMUSD school district is home to many well-respected schools that prepare kids for success upon graduation from high school. In fact, according to Niche.com, an online school district database, “Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District was ranked #548 out of the 10,574 school districts in the country. Within California, it ranked #29 out of 474” (Holland). Doing the math, these rankings place SMMUSD in the 95th percentile in the entire nation and the 96th percentile in the state of California in the quality of education it provides. As most of us would agree, kids who are being well educated all throughout their most important developmental years are considerably more likely to enjoy more success later on in their lives than kids who don’t receive the same solid schooling foundation. Having agreed to that, it’s reasonable to conclude that Santa Monica is caring - it really does care that Santa Monica kids are successful. On the same note, Santa Monica houses a flourishing higher education program, Santa Monica College (SMC). SMC proudly claims that it is the best transfer school in California. To better illustrate that, keep in mind the mind-boggling statistic that of all the students transferring to the University of Southern California: 46% are headed to UCLA (SMC Maintains No.1). UCLA, a school that is ranked as the 19th best university in America, it’s impressive that nearly half of the students transferring out of a community college into University of Southern California are going into such a well-respected four year institution. These impressive transfer statistics demonstrate that SMC is a well-equipped school that prepares its students for success later on in their academic and professional careers. With the City of Santa Monica being a direct supporter of SMC, the success students have can be directly attributed, at least in part, to Santa Monica. Again, showing that Santa Monica cares.  
Just as important as the quality education children receive, there is an abundance of accessible parks for kids and parents to enjoy. Like most people would agree, parents spending quality time with kids is essential to forming strong and lasting relationships. In these pictures of Douglas Park and Lincoln Middle School (transformed into a park by night), it is clear that Santa Monica City Government cares for its people because of all the money it invests in the successful operation of its parks and fields. For the parks to be functional and accessible, all the numerous acres of land need to be well-lit (to make sure the residents are safe and that no one gets hurt) and clean; both undertakings are undoubtedly pricy, but because they’re enacted, parents and kids can spend time together and residents  can build community bonds.  It’s evident that Santa Monica Government cares for its people through its support of city parks. At the same time, though, they don’t allow other issues escape their minds, which further proves that SM is caring.
Another dimension of Santa Monica caring: it supports its own small businesses. It is well documented that mega-chain superstores like Walmart, Target, and Amazon don’t have favorable effects on home-grown small businesses. To combat that, Santa Monica attempts to level the playing field by caring for its smaller businesses. For instance, (as pictured to the left) Santa Monica city government supports local farmers. Two days every week, the city shuts down multiple street blocks in Downtown Santa Monica in order to house farmers and their produce. Even though it may seem like a rather inconsequential effort from the city’s part to some people, it turns out to be ultra important boost to the local businesses. These (occasionally uneducated) farmers are provided with an opportunity to be self dependant entrepreneurs with a viable economic occupation alternative to working low paying industry jobs. Nothing screams that an organization is caring more than its efforts to provide its people with the freedom to maximize their potential - Santa Monica does just that by providing a venue for small-scale farmers to share their love with the rest of Santa Monica’s residents.
As was seen throughout the paper, much time was dedicated towards the gathering and analyzing of all the research data necessary to come to the stated conclusions. Local neighbors were asked for their political ideologies first hand; business experts’ quotes and real world business innovations were analyzed to better understand the business climate in Santa Monica; local government initiatives were examined to better understand the degree to which Santa Monica is concerned with its residents’ well-being. All in all, it seems like the data unanimously points to a single conclusion: Santa Monica is a very caring Liberal city that does well for itself financially. Having been a part of the Santa Monica for close to two decades now, I appreciate it for the amazing home it has been to me. Although not all American cities border the Pacific Ocean and not every town belongs to the mega city supercenter Los Angeles has evolved into, it’s important to recognize that every city has something special about itself that can make it an exemplary place. And no, not every city has to be a liberal business hub, but if every city chose to be the best city it can be for its people, then the world would become a better place.
