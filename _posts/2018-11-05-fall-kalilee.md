(Hook) Venice Beach continues to evolve in response to wanting to establish itself as an attractive tourist destination through the population living in the neighborhood, public art installments and events, and its differing retail and residential area development. The community attempts to balance and maintain its bohemian identity while driving itself to become a more affluent and white dominant community, which is ironically is driving the diverse community that inspired the artistic and outspoken nature of Venice out. The community continues to pay tribute to its art origins by organizing public art festivals and allowing an abundance of public and accessible murals throughout the community to attract both residents and tourists who are seeking a bohemian and carefree lifestyle. Differences between upscale shopping on Abbot Kinney Boulevard and the casual ambiance of Venice Boardwalk as well as differences in residential areas illustrate the different ways that Venice has grown in response to tourism and its desire to preserve its original nature.

A key aspect of being an appealing community for tourists to feel comfortable exploring is to be one that has the marks of a traditionally “safe” neighborhood. Safe neighborhoods in the united states are often marked by being white dominant, educated households, and economically being part of the middle or upper class.

Venice’s population today has a clear alignment with the commonly desired aspects of an American community. Sixty-four-point two percent of the population is white, has a relatively high average household income within Los Angeles County, and 49.3% of residents 25 years and older have a four year degree. Because of this, it is an area that many people would feel comfortable exploring on their own and to stay at during a vacation. White dominant communities are important to people as it is a common but not accurate form of measuring the safety of an area. Furthermore, education and higher than average household wealth demonstrates that people residing in the area are educated and are able to make thoughtful, lawful, and moral decisions. Additionally, the population is predominantly young or middle aged adults.  This age group demonstrates that most of the community is of working age. Therefore, they can afford to live in the unique, more expensive, and tourist driven area of Venice. The overall composition of Venice’s population today makes it a seemingly safe place for tourist to venture to and explore. 
   
Along with the composition of a neighborhood’s residential population, the appeal of an area is also influenced by the levels of homelessness. As I explored Venice, the boardwalk was swarming with tourists, the Venice canals had families going on weekend strolls and tourists photographing the unique are, and there no homeless tents anywhere. In fact, I only saw a handful of homeless people gathered in one alleyway adjacent to the boardwalk. In contrast to my hometown of Seattle where public lands are open for the homeless to stay and there are numerous homeless camps under bridges, along highways, and in public parks, it was surprising to see such few homeless people in an area that has many tourists who could afford to donate money and in an area that is expensive to pay for housing. Los Angeles County has however implemented regulations to prevent public spaces to become “potential sites of refugee for homeless people” by forbidding “sleeping on the beach, or in vehicles on public streets, or in tents, or engaging in other activities associated with homelessness [including disrobing, bathing, or shaving in public]” (Law, Robin). Consequently, much of LA County has made it illegal to be homeless. While this helps to mitigate the presence of homelessness in many tourist destinations like Venice, it also does not aid the homeless situation. Communities are pushing homeless-related issues to other neighborhoods when they should be implementing housing and shelter solutions for them instead. Many of the regulations targeted at removing homelessness can be seen throughout the community on street signs and residential sites.

The “Residential Quiet Zone” is not only prohibiting camping sites but also is preventing street vendors. This is ironic because it is attempting to separate the residential area on the boardwalk from the bohemian nature of Venice, which is a quintessential element of Venice’s appeal to tourists. Additionally, many residential areas, especially close to the beach, have many signs with the common message of “stay out.” This further demonstrates the community’s hostility towards homelessness and perhaps suggests that there are issues with homeless people attempting to reside in public and private areas throughout the neighborhood. Overall, Los Angles County and Venice have implemented many regulation and cultural standards in order to eliminate homeless people so that the neighborhood appears to be wealthier, safer, and more controlled to tourists. 

While being a safe place for nonlocals to navigate is important, Venice stands out from the other beach front neighborhoods throughout California because of its lively and unusual bohemian atmosphere. Along the boardwalk has an abundance of street performers, individual non-corporate vendors, and outdoor activities. Venice has a history of being a free spirited and expressive community as it was a “beatnik culture in 1950s, became an active hippy and political community in the 1960s, and emerged as an artist enclave in 1970s” (Deer, A.). The community strives to keep their unique atmosphere by maintaining “anticorporate” ideals for their brands (Deer, A.). This ideal for freedom of expression within the community has inspired a unique atmosphere that stands out from the structured, metropolitan environments of areas like Los Angeles City, San Jose, and San Francisco. Venice’s “free-spirited, anti-materialistic and inclusive nature” created by the “famed Muscle Beach outdoor gym, funky shops for souvenirs, street buskers, mimes to musicians and everything in between” made it an escape from the “homogenized, celebrity-obsessed, plasticized culture of Los Angeles” (McGrath). However, the eclectic and diverse scene at Venice is being threatened by the rise of “upscale boutiques, coffee bars, high-priced homes and gentrification” (McGrath). Although the initial attraction of Venice to tourists was characterized by its unique bohemian nature, the neighborhood now is struggling to balance becoming a more upscale, expensive, and trendy area with preserving its original artistic and diverse background.

As a neighborhood that was shaped by the artists living in the community, Venice continues to mark itself as a center of art and expression through attracting visitors with its Art Festivals. Not only do local businesses have murals along their exterior walls, but they also choose to engage in public art festivals as it is a major way to gain shoppers and visitors. By hosting Art Festivals, Venice is continuing to develop its presence as “artists enclave” and a place of free expression. Art Festivals have become an essential part of Venice’s tourism attracting “30,000 people each year” (Deener). Venice Art Walk emphasizes Venice’s narrative as “an influential artistic” while also drawing people into the neighborhood and retail areas (Deener). Through creating events like the Venice Art Walk, Venice is able to attract artist to continue to share their art – in shops, events, or street forms – throughout the neighborhood allowing Venice to continue to grow its collection of murals, vendors, and street artists. Furthermore, by attracting people who appreciate the self-expression and carefree expression of art, Venice continues to represent the diverse group of people who built the bohemian culture. It also promotes households who share the same values as people who attend these art festivals to want to reside in the neighborhood, which further allows Venice to preserve its bohemian roots. Another art festival that occurs at Venice beach is the Venice Beach Music Fest which is an annual free event that is sponsored by local and national businesses including “ Venice Beach Suites and Hotel, Royal Gold Potting Soil, The Sidewalk Café, Volcano Tea House, Marriott Marina Del Ray, Venice Boardwalk Association” and many more (Venice Beach Music Fest music and arts festival). A number of hotels including Venice Beach Suites and Hotel and Marriot Marina Del Ray help sponsor this major festival because it attracts tourists to visit and stay on their properties. Additionally, smaller business like The Sidewalk Café and Volcano Tea House also choose to invest in this event because the festival draws tourists to their retail spaces. Art festivals are essential to tourism in Venice as it drives art inclined tourists and residents to preserve the artistic origins of the neighborhood. 

In addition to art festivals, Venice continues his arts has a variety of murals on display throughout residential areas, retailers, and public spaces. Venice’s abundance of artwork displayed throughout the neighborhood makes it a very trendy, contemporary, and lively place to explore. In fact, Venice has a “Tour of Venice Murals” that was created by the Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC) dedicated to preserve Venice’s community and the muralists’ legacies (Stowell). Organizations like SPARC work to preserve Venice’s image as a center for artists. Doing so, allows Venice to keep its public artworks so that the values and aesthetics of the community endure.

Murals around Venice are present in visible and accessible areas. These murals are both for aesthetics – especially on hotels, which have images of the sunset and beaches painted alongside their exterior walls – and to spread messages like the “Endangered Species” mural. Venice embraces its quirky and bohemian nature by having an abundance of colorful, meaningful, or visually pleasing murals throughout its neighborhood. By having a plethora of public murals, Venice has differentiated itself from other communities allowing it to maintain its uniqueness and attraction to tourism.
