Strolling down the sidewalk of Oxnard Street located in North Hollywood, the longest mural in the United States painted by American Chicana artist and activist, Judy Baca, is visible adjacent to Ulysses S. Grant High School. A fence surrounds the 2754-foot wide depiction of the history of California, shown from the perspective of minorities. The fence, which was intended to keep the mural intact, symbolizes how minorities are fenced off by society. In fact, North Hollywood reflects a unique system of class, race, and gender that seems to represent one cultural experience while the neighborhood is simultaneously changing to represent the minority community. The underrepresented, working class population growing in North Hollywood oftentimes fall behind in occupations, education, and income when it comes to the socioeconomic status of the neighborhood. In terms of the racial demographics of North Hollywood, the area experienced a shift from an Anglo majority to the influx of a Latin American population. The area’s diversification has been met with conflict between the different ethnicities. When it comes to integration, women also experience a lack of representation and isolation from the community compared to men. Although many people live near the Great Wall of Los Angeles project, not all groups are embraced, and artist Judy Baca’s mural attempts to address the issues faced by these underrepresented groups in their North Hollywood community by portraying historical stories of the minorities to hopefully ensure greater understanding and create a more harmonious community.  
 North Hollywood neighborhoods are experiencing a transition from a disappearing middle class to an increase in minority populations that are seeking low-skilled jobs, lowering the city’s socioeconomic status. To accommodate this influx of the working class, more apartment complexes were built in the neighborhood, causing a rise in the number of low paying, seasonal jobs such as construction labor. As the lower-income class grew in the 1900s, skilled occupations in North Hollywood such as “the aeronautic industries fled to places like Texas and Georgia in search of educated workers, cheaper land and livable neighborhoods, then a domino effect ensued in which highly skilled residents fled, too” (Barrett, 2016). Highly skilled, middle class Anglos began leaving North Hollywood, and this phenomenon demonstrated the ongoing cycle in the demand for unskilled occupations by the new neighborhood residents. In other words, the community responded to the labor demands of immigrants by creating jobs that didn’t require skilled functions, while higher paid and educated workers sought jobs outside of North Hollywood. At the same time this shift was being influenced by the neighborhood, it was also shaping the culture of the neighborhood, resulting in new Hispanic restaurants and small businesses as well as cheaper rental units compared to the average prices in Los Angeles (Gropman, 2016). These more affordable prices meant more opportunities for the lower-income group. However, as North Hollywood began lowering community standards tailored to immigrant needs, the city was no longer able to compete with the rest of Los Angeles in terms of socioeconomic status. 
 Another challenge for neighbors with a lower socioeconomic status is finding quality education for their children. The quality of North Hollywood’s education system is considered poor compared to that of other cities in Los Angeles. Additionally, in the neighborhood there are fewer private schools than public schools, which are historically considered poorer performers. Based on the feedback from students and parents as well as from public data sources, schools in North Hollywood earn an average letter grade of a C, including categories of academics, teachers, clubs and activities, diversity, college preparation, and health and safety (niche). The lowest grade-earning categories were academics and college preparation, which demonstrates how the neighborhood has few resources to improve education for children. Given the poor educational environment, the progress of the community is unlikely to improve. For instance, in an interview, one of the residents, who grew up and remained in the neighborhood her whole life explained her experience at Grant S. Ulysses High School. She explained how there were lots of fights between different religious groups and ethnicities while she attended the high school, yet she perceived things recently improved approximately six years after she graduated. As she explains, “kids are more behaved now than before.” Therefore, based on the neighbor’s response, there is still segregation in the schools and they remain unsafe. However, there is still a hint of progress being made in the neighborhood toward a better educational environment. By improving children’s education, the neighborhood can facilitate a better future for the next generation.
 Along with education, another concern is the economic condition for residents due to North Hollywood losing a majority of the middle class population that has “relocated” upon noticing income shift in the neighborhood. The city has slipped to a lower socioeconomic status mainly due to an increase in the number of immigrants from Third World Countries, as well as the area’s attraction for those that seek more affordable living. This loss of a middle class means the average income for North Hollywood has decreased, as evident in Barett’s Middle-Class Flight from San Fernando Valley. While in 1970, “60 percent of Valley families could afford an average house and college costs, far outpacing other urban areas,” the number has declined to “43 percent of families by 2006 earning $50,000 to $149,000 – the identical income group, corrected for inflation, that made up 60 percent in 1970.” This data reveals that North Hollywood’s average income has not always been below LA’s; but rather, it has recently fallen due to the new neighbors’ sources of income that are comprised mainly of low-paying occupations. As a result, the low income of immigrants influences the status of the overall neighborhood by pulling down the average income, placing North Hollywood at a lower socioeconomic level relative to the surrounding cities in LA area.
 This economic change in North Hollywood parallels the changing racial demographic that has shifted from a dominance of Whites to a Latino-dominant neighborhood. Starting in the 1980s, there was an influx of Latin American immigration to areas around North Hollywood. It was during this time period when Anglos first started to feel dominated by the influx of Hispanic populations moving into the North Hollywood neighborhoods. Over 70% of North Hollywood used to be Anglos, and the residents at the time did not approve of the overcrowding and overdevelopment of the area that was occurring by the 22 percent immigrants, specifically Hispanics. Also as a result of the Latin American immigration, there was a rise in criminal and gang activity in the neighborhood, which troubled the Anglo residents (Quinn, 1992). This phenomenon demonstrated the Broken Window Theory, where visible cases of crime provokes more criminal activities. As a result of the worsening criminal activities among Latin American immigrants, the Anglo population grew worried about their safety and their children’s futures, prompting many to leave North Hollywood. Thus, the influx of a lower income population impacted the overall community by decreasing the standard of living in the neighborhood and changing the city’s ethnic proportions. In other words, the result of the increased immigration led to racial conflicts developing in North Hollywood, due to the Latino population overshadowing the Anglo population in both numbers and culture. 
 Diversity that developed in North Hollywood neighborhoods required the remaining Anglos to adjust to a changing racial demographic that the Hispanic residents had the ability to shape. Before the changes in the racial demographic of North Hollywood, the area was known for its exceptional segregation post-World War II with neighborhoods consisting of all white Americans and very distinguishable minority neighborhoods. As most white residents began to move away from North Hollywood to better urban neighborhoods, racial conflicts began to arise among Hispanics, a small Anglo population, and other minority groups. This is best exemplified in educational environments in which, “...tensions still exist in the high schools among fighting black and Latino students as well as between Latinos and Armenians.” (Uranga, 2017). As diverse ethnic groups and white Americans are now all living in one area, this unique social dynamic of North Hollywood is gradually changing its neighborhoods with racial tensions and conflicts at the root of the social change. As the driving force of social change in North Hollywood, racial conflicts are common struggles that are still faced within the community.
 Within the disadvantaged Latin American group, there is a segment that faces even greater challenges, the female Latino population. One of the greatest challenges is due to an employment gap in comparison to men. While women of most ethnicities face that to some degree, Latino women in North Hollywood seem to endure significant problems as a result of many Hispanic males exhibiting Machismo (Mcglynn, 1998). Machismo is a traditional Hispanic value that emphasizes exaggerated male masculinity and the responsibility to be the sole breadwinner of a family. As a result, women’s roles in Hispanic culture defaults to being a caregiver and mother, and the women that moved to North Hollywood were expected to continue conforming to the traditional Hispanic values even in Los Angeles.
 Another issue that restricted Latino women from working was the lack of educational opportunities. Lack of education meant lack of skills and missing opportunity to learn English that prevented them from entering the workforce. In fact, out of the six ethnic categories in female populations in North Hollywood, Hispanic women have the lowest percentage of employment of 58.1 %. In other words, Hispanic women are least represented in the work force and therefore have less of a voice in this community. Though 58% of Hispanic women in North Hollywood are employed, they often face difficulties due to low compensation from their occupations in comparison to men and even women of other ethnicities. For Hispanic women living in North Hollywood, the “industrial concentration in traditionally low-skill, low-wage sectors have the potential to severely limit the upward mobility of individuals, particularly the foreign-born who experience additional language and human capital barrier in addition to limited job information networks and varying levels of social capital” (Gleave, S and Wang, Q, 2013). Though Hispanic women in North Hollywood came to the U.S. with an intention to improve their lives, when comparing their lives to men and women of other ethnicities, they suffer the most economic challenges in North Hollywood society. Therefore, Hispanic women are considered disadvantaged in the workforce because they occupy the lowest percentage employment rate out of all gender and ethnic social categories. 
 The Great Wall of Los Angeles by muralist Baca provides a motivation for North Hollywood’s minority community, women, and differing social classes to harmonize and feel comfortable with their place in society. As the mural depicts the history of California from pre-historic times to the mid-1950s, there are many perspectives represented. The artist’s intended purpose with the mural was to elicit positive changes in the community by speaking up for the minority populations. Baca even employed minority youths to work on the mural and they were “carefully integrated and tasks were divided so as to create a situation of interdependence between crew members” (Baca, 1980). This project allowed the youths to gain more opportunities to cooperate with members of different ethnic groups, and by doing so, the project allowed them to understand different perspectives on racial conflicts, which was the original motivation for creating the mural. The Great Wall of Los Angeles also reflects the hopes of women in society, as it gives an “alternative form of history which would include formation of ethnic groups – including women in the various groups – in a manner not taught in the public schools” (Baca, 1980). In this way, the mural advocates for women, as well as disadvantaged minorities and ethnic groups that hope to become more integrated into the community. It also stands in the community as a reminder for the representation of everyone regardless of their status, by being a lens for the disadvantaged. Essentially, the mural provides cultural momentum and supportiveness for the entire North Hollywood neighborhood. 
 The cultural moment of the North Hollywood neighborhood is shaped by three factors- class, race, and gender. With the changing demographics came different jobs, which influenced both the educational opportunities and the average income for the neighborhood. In terms of race, the changes in the ethnic majority from Anglo to Latin American resulted in racial conflicts among the different ethnicities throughout the past few decades. Compared to men, women are still underrepresented in society, and this is clearly evident in North Hollywood. Now thanks to people like Baca and her Great Wall of Los Angeles, the community recognizes all individuals and their attempts to integrate into North Hollywood society. No matter their class, race, or gender, they all have a place in the neighborhood. The primary way to improve the existing system would be to continue helping all community members to have better education for their children, and better jobs and wages for themselves. Together, they can continue to build a dynamic community that is supportive of all individuals in working together to improve their lives. North Hollywood may be indicative of other areas, yet its rich cultural diversity, changing racial demographics, and emerging community cohesiveness makes it a truly unique addition to the Los Angeles area.
