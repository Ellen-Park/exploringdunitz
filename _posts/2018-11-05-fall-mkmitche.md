It is sometimes hard to believe that LA’s aesthetically pleasing and fashionable Arts District was once a place of hardship, violence, and separation from civilization. What used to be functional warehouses are now disguised with bright and colorful murals that sometimes reflect a critique on society, but also manage to attract people who seek the trendy and ideal instagram feed. The abundance of trendy and overpriced eateries and boutique shops superficially suggests that LA’s Arts District has always been this vibrant. The street art found in Downtown LA’s Arts District is reflective of the community’s ideals and demographics at the time they were created, and also serves as a source of collective identity. As a result, the overall changing aesthetic of the murals parallels and is directly related to the changing atmosphere and demographic of the Arts District. This is due to the recent influx of hip millenials, and is reflective of the gradual process of gentrification in the area. While the gentrification may bring a new crowd to the area, it simultaneously poses a threat to maintaining the authentic identity and historical significance of the Arts District.

In today’s version of the Arts District, it is evident that some of the historic and authentic traits or pillars of the neighborhood are still visible, but have modernized drastically since the era of its industrial peak in the mid twentieth century. In the mid 1800s, the Arts District was known for its vast landscape and warm climate that was perfectly suited for supporting a multiplicity of vineyards, which were soon replaced by various citrus fruits such as oranges and grapefruits that became the center of the Arts District’s commercial industry. The growth of the produce industry required the need for a railroad system “to serve the citrus industry’s shipping needs, and later to support the large number of people moving into California” (Los Angeles Conservancy, 2). Like in many areas during the Industrial Revolution, the expansion of the railroad into the Arts District transformed the landscape and the culture into a working-class commercial haven. With the transportation infrastructure already in place, the early twentieth century transition from the Arts District’s agricultural industry into a center for industrial warehouses and production centers was a fairly easy one. Gradually, however, the trucking industry took over as the primary shipping method due to its lower costs and higher accessibility and flexibility. Because the Arts District’s roads were initially built for the narrow and constantly bending railroad tracks, the use of the vehicular transportation method proved to be largely ineffective and inefficient. The area had a limited amount of land that was not large enough to support the booming economy that took off with the Industrial Revolution. Consequently, many factories and companies left their warehouses abandoned and empty in favor of newer commercial cities that could support their production needs. The then-abandoned warehouses were a perfect fit for aspiring artists to occupy in the 1970s as live-work spaces - albeit illegally. These artists created and built the foundation for a community that is heavily directly identified with the production and acceptance of world-class street art. This illegal immigration of artists from surrounding Los Angeles communities therefore marked the birth of the community that we now effectively deem as the Arts District.

Indents do not, so just put a space in for each new paragraph.

Formating is very simple in this document. 

To add an image you will use an exclamation point, then a description in brackets, and then the location of the image in parentheses. We will try to store ALL of our images in the GitHub repository.  There is also a little bit of text after the image in the special curly brackets and the word image inside it. Leave this alone! It displays the image in a special viewer so when you click on the image it opens it up in its own viewer and then you can cycle through all the images in this viewer. You can put in as many images as you like. Just always make sure to have the curly brackets afterwards.
