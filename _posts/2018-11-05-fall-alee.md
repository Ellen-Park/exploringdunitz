This is the body of your essay. You will copy and paste your essay into here. You will just delete all the text below and put in your own.

Spaces will work.

Indents do not, so just put a space in for each new paragraph.

Formating is very simple in this document. 

To add an image you will use an exclamation point, then a description in brackets, and then the location of the image in parentheses. We will try to store ALL of our images in the GitHub repository.  There is also a little bit of text after the image in the special curly brackets and the word image inside it. Leave this alone! It displays the image in a special viewer so when you click on the image it opens it up in its own viewer and then you can cycle through all the images in this viewer. You can put in as many images as you like. Just always make sure to have the curly brackets afterwards.

More than 50 people were killed and thousands were left injured in the L.A. Riots of 1992 (Medina, 2017). Houses and businesses were set on fire. A white truck driver was pulled out of his truck and his head was stomped into the ground. In the late 1990s, South Los Angeles was a difficult place for African Americans to live. Although the reasons have changed, South L.A. has remained an area where African Americans and other low-income groups struggle to reside. Since the late 1900s, University Park and the surrounding area has seen a decrease in diversity in the population due to racism and gentrification, which is shown through the artwork and signage in the community. University Park has long been a breeding ground of discrimination and bias. Faced with this escalating reality, African Americans have been forced to leave the community. Feelings of racism have decreased in recent years, but the gentrification of the neighborhood is continuing to drive out low-income families because they can no longer afford to live in the place they call home. Many of these changes can be seen in the signage and artwork throughout the community, which represent the majority Latino population that currently resides in University Park. Low-income populations have been struggling to live in University Park since the late 1900s. Racism, discrimination, and riots were a major contributor to the exodus of the African American population in the 1990s, while the gentrification of the neighborhood plagues low-income families that currently live in the area. In 1992, a mostly-white jury acquitted four white police officers of the videotaped brutal beating of an African American motorist who was pulled over for speeding. Almost immediately after the decision, riots broke out in South Los Angeles. The residents were furious and beat a white truck driver who tried to pass through the area. A state of emergency was declared by the mayor and the governor ordered the national guard to intervene because the riots were so intense (Mydans, 1992). Acquitting the white police officers was the last straw for many African American residents in the area. Upon witnessing such blatant racism and experiencing harsh police brutality, South Central L.A. saw an emigration of African Americans. The aftermath of the riots was apparent for many years and is still a source of tension between the African American community and the police in South Los Angeles (Medina, 2017).
