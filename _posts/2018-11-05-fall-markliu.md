   Visiting USC for the first time, the contrast between the surrounding neighborhood and the campus shocked me. Despite hearing stories about the dilapidated nature of the area, it was incredible that such enormous disparities in socio-economic status could occur within a mere two blocks of each other. It eventually became evident that the process by which racial tension and the constant threat of gentrification shape social change is integral to understanding the struggle of minorities and the poverty stricken in South Central Los Angeles. Residual tension from the Jim Crow Era and a confrontational relationship between law enforcement and minority communities exploded into racially charged riots that threatened to rip South Central apart. Additionally, looming gentrification has and will continue to impact a community disproportionately afflicted with higher rates of poverty and lower rates of education. It has been the goal of numerous organizations to mitigate the effects that the aforementioned issues have on the residents of South Central. 
   Many artists aim to bring awareness to important social issues through their work. In South Central, artist Noni Olabisi painted “To Protect and Serve”, a mural encapsulating the history of the Black Panther Party (BPP). The mural was based off the BPP’s attempts to end violence against blacks (Olabisi 2). Depicting the lynchings of the Jim Crow era, the drive towards civil rights, and the height of the organization, Olabisi argues that the BPP was a benevolent organization that was able to bring peace and prosperity to blacks (see fig. 1).

Despite Olabisi’s best intentions, the mural was rejected three times by the city council before being approved in a close vote (Von Blum 85). That the mural faced such staunch opposition indicates that many held onto the agitator stereotype of the BPP and were thus oblivious to its socially conscious aspects. Much like the relationship between conservative residents and Olabisi, the dynamic between minorities and law enforcement was often fraught with discord. 
  
  From Chief William Parker’s controversial career with the LAPD to the FBI’s takedown of the LA BPP, law enforcement has always been an adversarial figure in South Central. Blacks continue to be treated as second class citizens despite the widespread success of the civil rights movement. The plight of minorities was worsened during the career of Chief Parker. In the 1950’s, Parker proliferated the practice of racial profiling (Sonksen). By ratcheting up the violence in the communities he was supposed to serve, Parker undoubtedly seeded mistrust within the minority population. In 1968, a different law enforcement agency was alarmed by the radical viewpoints of the BPP. The FBI caused the assassinations of LA BPP leaders Bunchy Carter and John Huggins (Bloom). With the loss of resources and leadership, the free programs that once benefited the poor soon ceased to exist. Exacerbated by mistrust of law enforcement, racial unrest would translate into some of the worst riots in history.

Racial tensions, boiling from lynchings and police brutality, would soon reach a breaking point. A major contributing factor to rioting was the sense of helplessness that black communities were struggling to express. In 1965, while Marquette Frye was being detained for drunk driving, a crowd mobbed the police officers involved. The ensuing riots left thirty-four dead, more than a thousand wounded, and forty million dollars in damage (see figs. 2,3,4). That the rioters swarmed law enforcement so rapidly is a testament to their disapproval of Chief Parker’s racist policies. Decades later, after four cops were exonerated after beating an unarmed motorist bloody, another riot swept through South Central leaving sixty-three dead, two-thousand injured, and one billion dollars in damage (see figs. 2,3,4). With hispanics joining the later riots, the future of the community would be significantly altered. High levels of racial tension among increasingly diverse groups of residents meant that South Central was poised to enter into a new realm of issues. 

To comprehend the impact that gentrification has on South Central, the racial composition and socio-economic mobility of the area needs to be considered. After the banning of racial discrimination in the defense industry during WWII, the ethnic diversity of the neighborhood surged with its population (see fig. 5)

Today, South Central’s racial composition is 74% hispanic, 25% black, and 1% white (see fig. 7). The poverty and police brutality felt by the minorities moving in resulted in the chaos of the 1992 Riots. Only 6.6% of South Central residents have a bachelor’s degree, a third of the population lives below the poverty line, and 8.7% were able to move to a different city this past year (see figs. 8,9,10). As education is essential to socio-economic mobility, it is difficult for the uneducated to move to a more prosperous region. The inability of residents to voluntarily move means that gentrification will force them from their homes. This issue has been a long standing one.

Gentrification has been destroying the legacy of South Central. Originating in the 20th century, the neighborhood used to be a prosperous black neighborhood. However, redlining, restrictive housing covenants denying loans to specific groups of people, almost completely segregated the area by socio-economic status (Sonksen). Despite WWII anti-discrimination policies which opened up thousands of jobs to minorities, redlining forced all those workers to settle in South Central. This overcrowding led to progressively poorer conditions for the region. One of the worst cases of gentrification occurred with the 1960’s construction of the I-10 interstate. The highway destroyed the South Central neighborhood of Sugar Hill (Sonksen). The decision by the LA City Council to proceed with the highway construction was more than a purely economic issue. It could have been racially motivated by fear and jealousy of wealthy minority communities traditionally associated with the area. This pervasive issue continues to affect the area to this day through new developments.

Unfortunately, gentrification in South Central has only been getting worse. The problem manifests itself in the form of stadium renovations and unchecked rent raises. The recent arrival of the LA Rams football team has necessitated the expansion of the metro transportation system. (Sonksen). Because of the expanded metro line, residents are being pushed further away from their homes. The rising prices in new stores and restaurants nearby is just a fraction of the costs residents have to bear. Increasing property values and decreasing construction space has caused rent to skyrocket in the neighborhood. In 2017, the median monthly rent for a one bedroom apartment in South Central was nearly $2000 (Sonksen). For residents living off of $1000 social security checks and $200 food stamps, these rent increases leave many homeless. The expanding trajectory of urban development ensures that other South Central residents will lose their homes forever. Though the gentrification situation remains dire, numerous organizations are in the process of enacting social change.

Despite its militant connotations, the BPP was a benevolent organization whose purpose was to aid the poor. During its peak years, the organization operated diverse programs ranging from free food to free healthcare. In 1968, the BPP started its free breakfast program. By 1969, it was providing a complimentary morning meal to thousands of children across nineteen American cities including South Central (Chiles). The exponential expansion of the free breakfast program speaks to efficacy of the BPP. Considering that it was the organization’s first foray into major relief, the rapid success was even more incredible. Another BPP program was the People’s Free Medical Clinics which provided disease testing, vaccines, and physicals for those in South Central and twelve other American cities (Chiles). The impact of the program was tremendous as it brought international attention to Sickle Cell Disorder while also providing a launchpad for many future black doctors. Although the BPP is no more, their legacy of social change has inspired many today.

Non-profit organizations across South Central affect significant social change. From mitigating racial tensions to staving off gentrification, numerous groups are seeking to rectify centuries of injustice. The South Central Dreamers (SCD) recruit youth activists who are educated on important issues like racism and gentrification. Another group, Strategic Actions for a Just Community (SAJE) provides social justice and civil rights internships to deserving minority youth (Sonksen). By providing education that instills a sense of justice and opportunities that foster potential for tangible change, the SCD and SAJE are paving the way for a brighter future in their neighborhoods. Nearby, USC alumna Vanessa Luna works with nonprofit Clifford Beers Housing to construct affordable homes for South Central residents (Oganesyan 1). Luna’s education at a prestigious college which happens to be situated in the source of the issue indicates that she has the ethos to help fight gentrification in the area. Nonprofits are not the only groups that are attempting to help out the underserved.

There are profit based entities in South Central that look out for the needy. With the dearth of affordable grocery stores and lack of quality hospitals in the neighborhood, residents are forced to subsist off unhealthy foods and pray for good health. Fortunately, Everytable, and the USC’s medical centers exist to mitigate these issues. The mission of Everytable, a restaurant chain, is to provide underserved communities with cheap nutritious meals (Harris). Feeding countless hungry mouths with its recent rapid expansion, the company’s business model appears to be working. When medical emergencies arise, residents often find that the nearest hospitals too far away or too expensive. For these people, the USC’s medical centers provide top notch medical care at an affordable price (Uber interview). USC’s medical centers outshine other South Central hospitals which prioritize making a profit over aiding the poor. If poverty is ever eradicated from South Central, organizations like Everytable and the USC medical centers should be celebrated for their efforts.

Rife with hatred and prejudice, the legacy of pre-civil rights America pushed minorities to revolt against what they believed was an unjust system. It is no wonder that lower levels of educational attainment and higher levels of poverty in South Central created an environment that has and is forcing residents out in the name of luxury and urban development. These issues are being tackled by an array of organizations that aim to affect social change. With that in mind, both racial violence and looming gentrification are necessary to understand what the underserved in South Central have and will continue to face on a daily basis. After matriculating at USC, a mere two months is all it took for me to firmly grasp the causes behind the asymmetry of my college and South Central. If only the issues behind that inequality could be solved in such a short period of time.
