New York City is the greatest city in the world. But since I’m now a resident of Los Angeles, I must put my preferences aside and settle for something that comes close enough. Koreatown, overlooking its names implications, houses many cultures and epitomizes a true city. This is because it’s central and populous, attractive to millenials, and undergoing gentrification due to the influx of new inhabitants. Koreatowns high population density and accessible transportation is a big contributor to its city-like atmosphere. It’s desired by a younger generation because of the ability to have an urban lifestyle, and Koreatowns wave of gentrification is stemming from its expense and increase in new development, which is also causing a displacement of the current residents.  
 One of the biggest differences between large cities and suburban communities is the population, specifically population density. Koreatown has a population of over 125,000 people and a density of approximately 43,000 people per square mile (Census Reporter). This makes Koreatown the densest neighborhood in Los Angeles and one of the densest cities in the entire country. Koreatowns high population density helps contribute to the feeling of living in a “true city”, and certainly makes it stand out from the other residential areas of Los Angeles. The Census Bureau identifies an “urbanized area” as an area with a population of 50,000 or more (Brasuell, 2012). By this definition, Los Angeles as a whole is clearly an urban community, but Koreatown as a neighborhood within Los Angeles is approaching that benchmark as well. Due to Koreatowns population, not only do they qualify as an actual urban city, but it helps make it feel like one as well. 



To add an image you will use an exclamation point, then a description in brackets, and then the location of the image in parentheses. We will try to store ALL of our images in the GitHub repository.  There is also a little bit of text after the image in the special curly brackets and the word image inside it. Leave this alone! It displays the image in a special viewer so when you click on the image it opens it up in its own viewer and then you can cycle through all the images in this viewer. You can put in as many images as you like. Just always make sure to have the curly brackets afterwards.
