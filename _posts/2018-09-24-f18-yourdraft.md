New York City is the greatest city in the world. But since I’m now a resident of Los Angeles, I must put my preferences aside and settle for something that comes close enough. Koreatown, overlooking its names implications, houses many cultures and epitomizes a true city. This is because it’s central and populous, attractive to millenials, and undergoing gentrification due to the influx of new inhabitants. Koreatowns high population density and accessible transportation is a big contributor to its city-like atmosphere. It’s desired by a younger generation because of the ability to have an urban lifestyle, and Koreatowns wave of gentrification is stemming from its expense and increase in new development, which is also causing a displacement of the current residents.  
 One of the biggest differences between large cities and suburban communities is the population, specifically population density. Koreatown has a population of over 125,000 people and a density of approximately 43,000 people per square mile (Census Reporter). This makes Koreatown the densest neighborhood in Los Angeles and one of the densest cities in the entire country. Koreatowns high population density helps contribute to the feeling of living in a “true city”, and certainly makes it stand out from the other residential areas of Los Angeles. The Census Bureau identifies an “urbanized area” as an area with a population of 50,000 or more (Brasuell, 2012). By this definition, Los Angeles as a whole is clearly an urban community, but Koreatown as a neighborhood within Los Angeles is approaching that benchmark as well. Due to Koreatowns population, not only do they qualify as an actual urban city, but it helps make it feel like one as well.  
 As a New Yorker, the thing I dislike most about Los Angeles is how widespread the entire city is, and without a car, it’s nearly impossible to get around. My biggest gripe is the inconvenient public transportation; however, this is not the case in Koreatown. Los Angeles is notoriously a driving city. In a region of 13 million people, approximately only 360,000 people use the rail on an average weekday. Comparatively, New York state with a population of roughly 20 million, has around 5 million subways riders on an average weekday. Being a car owner can be extremely expensive and Los Angeles has been making huge efforts to upgrade the cities public transportation system as it’s becoming increasingly important for many people, particularly millennials (Panagiotopoulos, 2017). Koreatown was voted the eighth most fuel-efficient big neighborhood in the country because everything is in extremely close proximity. Almost everything can be done on foot which is an uncommon characteristic of most Angeleno neighborhoods (Loc, 2016). Koreatown is much more compact than the majority of other LA neighborhoods and the ability to get around by walking certainly alludes to similar characteristics found in what I, and many others consider to be a pinnacle city of the world, New York City. In addition to being walkable, Koreatown is in close proximity to three major freeways. It’s also close to Downtown LA, and is served by both the Red and Purple Line (Aron, 2017). Since Koreatown is an easily accessible city, it isn’t difficult for visitors to get in and out. It also makes it an appealing place to work and live and is a major source of its desirability as an up and coming community. Koreatown is regarded as a city within a city which can be largely attributed to its convenient transit, drawing in all kinds of people who are looking to become city dwellers. 
   In recent years, many young people desire an urban lifestyle in big cities which makes Koreatown an attractive place to live. Peter Strauss, Iconic Investments founder states that the changing demographics of Koreatown is driven by millenials. He says that most of them don’t have cars, so parking is less important to them since they have easy access to Uber and the Metro (Jordan, 2017). Since Koreatown is so easy to navigate, it makes it extremely popular for young people looking for a convenient, inexpensive lifestyle. The influx of younger resident leads to a busier and more city-like environment. 




To add an image you will use an exclamation point, then a description in brackets, and then the location of the image in parentheses. We will try to store ALL of our images in the GitHub repository.  There is also a little bit of text after the image in the special curly brackets and the word image inside it. Leave this alone! It displays the image in a special viewer so when you click on the image it opens it up in its own viewer and then you can cycle through all the images in this viewer. You can put in as many images as you like. Just always make sure to have the curly brackets afterwards.
