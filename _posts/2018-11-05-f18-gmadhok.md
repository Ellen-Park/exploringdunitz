 Hook. The ethnically and socioeconomically diverse group of hard-working individuals that inhabit University Park are being shaped by the change occuring in the neighborhood due to gentrification as it alters the landscape of the community and leads to adverse mental, health and educational impacts for residents. Gentrification is the process by which low-income residents of neighborhoods are replaced with more affluent ones, which can be seen by looking at the changing demographics of a region. The process of gentrification occurs because the real estate in these neighborhoods is cheap, and developers are able to make a profit by building there. Since developers want to build in these areas, redevelopment begins to take place, which drives up the cost of living to more than the low-income families can afford and perpetuates the cycle of gentrification. Because of gentrification, individuals and families become displaced, increasing the homeless population. Additionally, the landscape of the community changes as new and more upscale shops and markets are added. As the features of the neighborhood change, residents desire a response from city leaders. When residents become displaced and have to leave community support systems, they incur a high mental health cost. Furthermore, moving to a new places forces individuals to find new ways of maintaining health, leading to negative health impacts. Finally, for children in school, displacement caused by gentrification prevents students from receiving a steady education and puts them at risk of dropping out.    
 First, gentrification is a process occurring in the University Park neighborhood that is changing the demographics and landscape of the community. According to the Encyclopedia of Environmental Change, the process of gentrification is when “traditional inner-city” neighborhoods are replaced with new and improved housing, new market services, and more affluent inhabitants. Gentrification takes time, but its effects can be seen through the changing demographics of regions. According to Woocher, the African American population in Los Angeles has fallen in a few decades from 13% of the total population to 8%. Along with the decreasing African American population, Woocher also indicated that 13,000 Latinxs were displaced in the Hollywood region between 2000 and 2010 due to upscale redevelopment pushing up rent. This data demonstrates that gentrification is happening in Los Angeles because the demographics of the county are changing. As gentrification occurs over time, redevelopment begins to happen, which in turn pushes up rents and displaces groups of people who cannot afford to pay the increasing cost of living. Because of this, in neighborhoods such as University Park, gentrification is taking place and changing the landscape of the area. In addition to the changing demographics showing gentrification in University Park, census data shows that “92.2% of the occupied housing units are rented and only 7.8% are owned”. Because only 7.8% of the housing units are owned, the majority of the tenants are renters and are affected by the changes to rent that happen due to redevelopment and gentrification. In the University Park neighborhood, gentrification takes the form of redevelopment, improved housing and services, increasing rent, and more affluent inhabitants. 
 Gentrification takes place in areas such as University Park because the real estate is cheaply available and can be resold for a higher price. When developers begin to build new homes in an area, it begins a cycle of gentrification in the region. The new homes are more expensive and drive up the cost of living, displacing lower-income individuals and bringing in affluent ones. When more affluent individuals move into an area, the market services become more upscale, sparking the desire for other affluent individuals to move to that community, changing the demographics of the region completely. This process is common in Los Angeles. According to Woocher (2017), “Los Angeles was recently voted the number-one site for real estate investment in North America”. Because Los Angeles is seen as a lucrative place for real estate investment, developers want to find regions in Los Angeles to build in. The cheaper places to find these regions tend to be in lower-income communities. Developer David Pourbaba stated in the LA Times (2016) that South Los Angeles is “one of the best neighborhoods left” to invest in because land can be purchased for “around $80 a square foot, compared with $500 a square foot downtown”. The massive difference in cost per square foot between South Los Angeles and downtown indicates exactly why real estate developers value land in low-income communities. Because the land is cheaper, developers are able to build better and more improved buildings for cheaper. Since many developers are doing this at the same time, the market areas around these new buildings begin to become more upscale, creating more desire for affluent inhabitants to purchase these new homes and apartments and move into the neighborhood. When this cycle repeats and continues occurring, it is gentrification.  
 When redevelopment happens in a region, the cost of living increases. The increase in the cost of living pushes out those who can no longer afford to live there and replaces them with more affluent individuals. According to a report cited by Velez (2015), “A high poverty rate, unemployment and underemployment in the community made it a challenge for some members to afford housing”. In South Los Angeles, all these factors combine to make it extremely difficult to afford housing. Because of the high poverty rate and the high unemployment, inhabitants of South Los Angeles struggle to find work to pay for the increasing costs of living in the region. According to Woocher (2017), South Central Los Angeles is “the most over-crowded neighborhood in the country… and 8-in-10 residents are renters”. Woocher goes on to explain that around 70% of the individuals that rent “spend more than 30% of their income on shelter”. The imbalance between income and cost of living, especially for shelter, puts residents in a tough situation where they have to decide whether they can spend that amount of money on shelter. The high poverty rate coupled with the ever increasing cost of living contributes to the cycle of gentrification and displaces lower-income residents, replacing them with more wealthy inhabitants. Because of the struggle to find affordable housing for low-income individuals, gentrification takes place. 
 When a community undergoes gentrification, it leads to displacement and increased homelessness in the region. Through the pictures taken from the fieldwork in University Park, the homeless population can be seen living in tents on the sidewalks. According to Woocher (2017), gentrification reaps “hefty profits” for the real estate investors and developers while leaving the poor residents displaced or homeless. If the residents are displaced, they can either remain in the area homeless or try to find somewhere to live “far away from their jobs, families, and communities”. Gentrification creates this situation for poorer residents in these areas by forcing them to make a decision on keeping their jobs and becoming homeless or trying to start a new life in a different community. Furthermore, a report published by Human Impact Partners (2015) estimates that “4,445 renters within a ½ mile of The Reef development face a high or very-high risk of displacement”. The data from the report indicates that the development taking place in the region is leaving thousands of residents at risk of displacement, showing how gentrification changes the landscape of a community. Additionally, Woocher stated that from 2015 to 2016, South Central experienced “a 44% increase in homelessness”. This large leap in homelessness in the region demonstrates the effects of gentrification and shows how gentrification completely alters the landscape of communities through increased displacement and homelessness. 
 In addition to the changes in homeless population showing the effects of gentrification, the community landscape itself, such as the shops and services available, shifts when gentrification occurs. According to Khouri (2016), an example of this is a 30-story tower that would bring “1,218 homes and up to 300,000 square feet of office, retail and restaurant space”. This huge development project completely changes the landscape of the community. For this reason, some community members started a lawsuit against the company developing the project. In regions undergoing gentrification, developers bring in massive projects such as this to increase the desire of affluent individuals to move to that community. Because of this, the process of gentrification not only impacts the demographics of a region, but also the shops and spaces that exist for residents. After conducting the fieldwork of University Park, one particular area of interest stood out, Mercado la Paloma. Mercado la Paloma is a food court and market in University Park that shows the changing landscape of the region. Within the Mercado, there are quick service restaurants with diverse cuisines from Ethiopian to Thai to Mexican. There is also a large price range between the restaurants, catering to a varying socio-economic status of those who enter the Mercado. The shops in the Mercado sold ethnic clothing as well as USC apparel, showing how the community landscape is being impacted by its proximity to USC. When gentrification occurs in a region, the goods and services as well as the markets change and become more upscale to cater to the more wealthy inhabitants moving to the area, shifting the entire community landscape. 
 When a community undergoes gentrification, residents often go to city leaders for a response to the effects of gentrification. One way in which the mayor of Los Angeles responded to gentrification was to try and address the homelessness crisis. Wampler (2016) stated that Eric Garcetti proposed to increase spending on homelessness from $18 million to $138 million in the 2016-2017 budget. This drastic increase in funding to combat homelessness was his response to the crisis and the effect of gentrification in the form of homelessness. As the landscape of Los Angeles continues to change due to gentrification, residents continue to look to city leaders, such as the mayor, to take action to improve the lives of those affected. Although the mayor has tried to take action, many residents feel as though they are not being heard and their needs are not being attended to. According to Anderson (2017), UNIDAD member Ishmail Marcus Allgood stated "We're not against development in the city. What we're against is the displacement of the working class, the middle class...we want to be included in the development and planning of the city”. Allgood’s words show that residents of communities undergoing gentrification want to be part of the conversation that makes decisions about developments in the city. Residents want development and better resources and markets for themselves and become frustrated when development only occurs when more wealthy individuals move to a neighborhood. The desire of residents for a conversation with city leaders and developers illustrates that residents want to have a say in the changing landscapes of their communities and do not want development to only come in the form of gentrification.
 Gentrification affects the mental health of the community in a few ways. When gentrification occurs, it often leads to displacement. Displacement of members of a community affects those displaced as well as those remaining in the community. According to Cohen (2014), “Long-time neighborhood residents commonly develop deep social ties and strong social support networks within the community. When the neighborhood and social connections therein are broken up, this ‘social loss’ creates excess stress and psychological effects”. Cohen illustrates a topic of importance in the gentrification discussion, the mental health of a community undergoing gentrification. Being part of a community and feeling a sense of home within that community provides “many social and health benefits”. When a person is part of a community for many years and becomes displaced, it takes a large mental toll on the person as they lose not only their home, but also their community and support system. Additionally, Tran (2018) found that “gentrification imposes a mental health cost on longtime residents and the most financially vulnerable residents”. Tran’s research demonstrates that the people that have lived in a community the longest and are the least financially stable bear a large mental health cost. The cost is likely because they are the most connected to their community after having lived there for so long, and they are also the most likely to be displaced as they are not financially stable. This combination may force these residents to have to move from their home and try to build a new life somewhere else, leaving them with potential mental health issues. Because of this information, it can be understood that gentrification has significant mental health effects, particularly for the most financially vulnerable populations. 
 In addition to the mental health effects caused by gentrification, there are also many adverse health effects. Because gentrification forces displacement and movement of populations, it can affect the access to healthy food choices, transportation, exercise facilities, and schools for those populations. According to a report produced by the Association of Bay Area Governments “Development without Displacement” (2009), “Vulnerable populations typically have shorter life expectancy; higher cancer rates; more birth defects; greater infant mortality; and higher incidence of asthma, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease”. These terrible health effects that are caused by gentrification can be attributed to the results of displacement due to gentrification. When individuals have to leave their communities, they must find new places to go for their healthcare, new places to buy their food, new places to exercise, etc. Not having access to all these parts of a healthy life leads to all the negative health effects. According to Macias and Morales (2000), “The high cost of health care prevented almost 60 percent of participants from seeking care, even when it was felt necessary”. In this study, the results showed that health care has an extremely high cost, and the cost itself prevented the majority of the participants from seeking the health care that they needed. When gentrification occurs in a community, the cost of living is a main factor in figuring out who becomes displaced. For those already in that vulnerable position, adding on the cost of healthcare is extremely difficult and leads to all these adverse health effects as a result of gentrification.
 Gentrification not only has unfavorable mental and health effects but also negative effects on the education of those affected by gentrification. The displacement that happens as a result of gentrification has extremely terrible effects on the education of students who are displaced. Students are forced to move schools and have to learn how to navigate a new school again. According to the census data from University Park, only 5 out of the 34 schools listed in the area have a rank of 8 out of 10 and above. This data shows that students at these schools are not receiving an adequate education in the first place, and displacement will only make that situation worse. According to Gasper (2012), “Students who change schools are more likely to drop out”. This finding clearly indicates that when students switch schools, their education is negatively affected as they are more likely to drop out. However, this study took into account other factors on students who move often, such as more school absences, a non-intact family, lower incomes, etc. The study found that even after taking into account these risk factors and comparing students who had these factors and moved schools to students who had these factors but did not move, there was still an “increased dropout by between 6% and 9%” for students that changed schools. The results of this study demonstrate that moving schools has a direct relationship with dropping out of school. Students who switch schools have a more difficult time adjusting to the new school and being successful within it. Because of this, gentrification has a direct impact on the education of students that are affected by gentrification. If they are displaced due to gentrification and forced to attend a new school, the students will experience negative effects on their education.
 In conclusion, the replacing of traditional inner-city neighborhoods with upscale services, improved homes and more affluent inhabitants is gentrification. Real estate developers desire to build in these neighborhoods because the land is cheap and allows them to make a profit. When the region is being redeveloped, the cost of living in the area, specifically rent, increases. Gentrification leads to displacement and enlarges the homeless population. Furthermore, gentrification alters the way a community looks and what goods and services it offers. The changing landscape of the community forces members of the community to try and speak with city leaders to bring change. Displacement and separation from community due to gentrification leaves residents with mental health struggles. In addition to mental health problems, gentrification also causes health issues as individuals and families have to figure out how to maintain their health in new communities. Finally, gentrification leads to an increased rate in dropping out for students because they have to move schools and adjust to new learning environments. In the University Park neighborhood, gentrification is reshaping the landscape of the community and increasing the likelihood of negative mental, health and education effects on the hard-working and diverse group of residents of University Park.
