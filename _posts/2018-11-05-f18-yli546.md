Los Angeles (LA), the second largest city in the United States, embraces the infusion of culturally dynamic demographics. As a sophomore in the University of Southern California (USC), I have acquainted myself with people of different racial background, of different gender representations and different social status. They come from different parts of the world to receive higher education and prepare themselves with skills necessary for the future employment. However, educational and career opportunities are not open to everyone living in this city. A large proportion of them are suffered from the “inferiority” associated with their background, and a lot of people are deprived of employment and educational support due to their racial minority, gender inequality, and class mediocrity. Regarding racial background, African Americans, Hispanics, and Latinos are discriminated due to their immigrant background. They often receive unfair treatment, such as underpayment and curtailment in basic welfare. Also, the lack of education could not prepare them with sufficient skills to become competent enough in higher-paying jobs. Moreover, gender also largely influences decision-making in employment and education. If you are a woman working and living in LA, you are less likely to get promotion and receive equal employment opportunities than the male counterpart. With the addition of social prejudice, specific industries, such as management and administration, have overwhelmingly limited women roles. Furthermore, class structure plays a pivotal part in deciding a person’s quality of life, and that largely depends on your ethnoracial background and geographical location in the whole city. If you belong to one of the racial minorities and reside in a compact region around downtown, you are probably defined as “lower-class”. Thus, demographic factors, including race, gender, and class, directly influence your career and educational opportunities, which directly impact your overall quality of living. 

Racial and cultural diversity is characteristic of LA. However, people of different ethnic background receive different treatment in terms of their employment and educational opportunities. Nowadays, white and Asians usually prevail in different settings, but African Americans and Hispanics suffer significantly from the unfair treatment mainly due to discrimination. In the following table, Latino immigrant (13%), Latino, U.S.-born (33%), and black (36%) have the least access to high-opportunity jobs, while white (58%) are most likely

to be employed in a high-opportunity occupation. One of the reasons associated with differences in their access to career opportunities is racial discrimination. This issue has been raging since the foundation of this very country. Years after years, activists gather together and make voice to counteract against the bias in order to suppress such behaviors in the future. However, “the association between ethnoracial diversity and everyday discrimination is positive.” In the following table, Latinos (2.64, 0.43, 0.23) are more likely to receive different types of discrimination than U.S.-born whites (0.43, 0.26, 0.10).

On one side, discrimination has disabled minority groups to build networks with management and administrative levels, thus cutting off some opportunities to getting promotion and get fair pay. On the other side, racial discrimination would invite dissent and even strike, which once occurred on our university campus. In USC, nonwhite workforce, including “black or brown, with the vast majority being Latino”, is employed for elementary food-related and cleaning-related services. Due to “the university’s unfair labor practices” at one time, including “deploying the notion of ‘community’ as an inclusive term that served to suppress difference under a rhetoric of ‘common goals’”, service workers organized a strike, The USC You Never See, consisting of marching bands in Pershing Square in downtown LA in the last century. Nowadays, USC has modified terms and policies to satisfy the demands of local workers and safeguard their equality in terms of welfare and benefits. However, as most local workers only possess the most basic skills, including cleaning and food preparation, their earnings are usually low and subject to replacement and layoffs. 

Gender equality, as a common goal for every country and social structure, is usually compromised because of social prejudice. Even though women’s career involvement has exceeded that of men in certain occupations, including office and administrative support (17% and 8%), sales and retail-related occupations (12% and 11%), and business and

financial (6% and 4%). Women’s distribution over different industrial sectors barely increases over a decade. In the following table, most of the women’s occupations stay constant, and some of them even decrease from 2000 to 2012. Even for gendered and higher-paying careers such as STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) and architecture, women’s participation is almost minimal. “only 2.5% of all LA women work in the higher-paying, STEM-related fields, compared with 6% of all LA men,” and it “is the same in 2012 as it was in 2000.” The reason behind the stagnancy in women’s involvement of STEM-

related fields is largely the negative stereotypes, which consist stereotypical beliefs such as "girls are not as good as boys in math and science” for boys and men." and "scientific work is better suited for boys and men." Women students may reduce the likelihood by connecting these social judgements with themselves and avoiding these fields of study. Therefore, these stereotypes act as threats, imposing “an extra cognitive and emotional burden of worry” and negatively affecting women’s performance on these social fields. However, in USC, the male-to-female ratio has approximated to 6:4 (57% and 43%). Although faculty members in fields of engineering and science augment the proportion to 7:3 (67% and 33%), the incoming class keeps creating new records of gender ratio (56% and 44% in Fall 2017) with the increasing female population in the overall student body.

Moreover, in some of the traditionally male-dominant programs and majors of study, USC has achieved the equality in male-to-female distribution. For example, “USC’s Marshall School of Business is the first major U.S. school to reach gender parity in its full-time MBA program.”

Due to the multiculturalism in LA, the metropolis is fractured into various neighborhoods, where people of different ethnoracial background create different class structures in different geographical locations. “The service class is clustered in broad swaths between and further beyond these creative class districts near downtown and further out in the suburban periphery.” while “L.A.'s creative class, much of which is no doubt afﬁliated with the ﬁlm and television industry, is more spread out along the coast.” Unlike other major cities in the United States, such as New York, LA does not share the same centralized structure, where “lower-wage service workers concentrated in the urban core and the more afﬂuent creative class at the suburban fringe.” Instead, “L.A.'s ongoing transformation and gentriﬁcation takes shape around a more spread out pattern.” Therefore, upper-class residents are sometimes a street away from lower-class residents. However, they enjoy entirely different opportunities in employment and education. For example, in the USC and Exposition Park community as a whole, the lower-level service class is dominant (top 3 by 79.5% of total population) as a large number of surrounding residents are employed as food-related and cleaning-related workers in USC. Every morning I go out, I could always see a 50-year-old janitor resting in a room with his door slightly open. He would usually greet me whenever I meet him, but he could only rest in a room half of my current bedroom. On the other side, distinguished faculty members have their own spacious offices, which can accommodate at least 4-5 students comfortably. Therefore, due to the lack of educational attainment, service workers are not able to master sufficient skills to compete for intellectually-challenging, well-paid occupations, leading directly to a poor working environment and downgraded social status. 

In conclusion, employment and education affect everyone throughout his or her life. Employment is defined as a distribution of wealth and opportunities through the occupation of a person’s skills, time, and other resources when education refers to the process of learning in enriching a person’s knowledge and strengthening his or her abilities. As both represent pursuits for almost everyone living in LA, it is deeply related to everyone’s demographics, including race, gender, and class. Each of the factors is critical to decide whether a person could gain physical and mental well-being.
