“Welcome to Hollywood where money literally grows on trees and litters the streets…” reads a caption of a random Instagram photo uploaded under the location of Downtown LA (Bennett). The uploader, a costume designer, captures a set for a tv show where fake money drifts around the streets of Downtown LA for a scene –and while the dollar bills will be picked up from the streets after filming, the influence of new money infiltrating Downtown LA will never be unseen (Bennett). Its new symbolic presence has prompted Downtown LA, a former unique neighborhood, towards becoming a more mainstream neighborhood in relation to its defining characteristics. Compared to historical demographics and public street art, the culture of Downtown Los Angeles’ people is being slowly eradicated through restoration. As the neighborhood evolves, the historical, diverse makeup of Downtown LA is being overtaken by higher income residents. Historical public art that once defined the neighborhood by promoting culture and unity also faces extinction. Through intervention of the neighborhood’s architecture, art, and prices, the City of LA is currently focusing on eradicating these key pillars that shaped Downtown LA in order to redefine it for monetary gain.  
 Originally inhabited by minorities, Downtown LA historically served as the cultural epicenter of Los Angeles. When 44 Spanish settlers migrated to Los Angeles on September, 4, 1781, they founded El Pueblo de La Reina, an area that would later be known as the Historic Core of Downtown LA (Downtown LA History). With a land boom in the 1800s, this area was populated by an influx of people and characterized by increasing industry and transportation by railroads. The completion of the Southern Pacific, Atchison, Topeka, Santa Fe, and Union Pacific Railroads by 1905 prompted the further construction of warehouses and industrial buildings, leading Downtown LA into the Industrial Age (The Los Angeles Conservancy). Because of available residential land and available jobs in industries such as the automobile and rubber industry, Downtown LA proved to be an attractive place for immigrants looking to establish themselves and their culture. Downtown’s many divisions such as Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Arts District, and Central City East are the result of these foreigners’ immigration and support Henri Lefebvre’s notion that “social relations are produced and sustained through space” (Jenks). Little Tokyo perfectly exemplifies how Downtown LA allowed community members to establish their roots and identities in such a heterogeneous society. Many of the art and the buildings in Little Tokyo tell the story of Japanese exclusion and serve as the foundation for Japanese American history. The Hompa Hongwanji Buddhist Temple, built in to 1925, was a popular religious and social space for the Japanese living in LA pre-World War 2 (Little Tokyo Historic District). Much of its architecture mimics that of important temples in Kyoto, Japan and therefore serves as a strong tie for the Japanese to their home. Today, the building is occupied by the Japanese American National Museum’s National Center for the Preservation of Democracy, something that Japanese Americans were denied of during World War II (Little Tokyo Historic District). Although only one of the many important buildings still standing in Little Tokyo, the Hompa Hongwanji Buddhist Temple demonstrates how downtown LA has helped Japanese Americans maintain connection to their ethnic identity. The temple, now museum, is a physical testimony to the hardships Japanese Americans had to face and serves to bring the past and present together in order to shape the future. This physical space not only helps give Japanese Americans a sense of membership and a connection with their peers, but also helps others gain understanding of accurate Japanese American culture and the impact and importance of cultural diversity in Downtown LA. Other historic cultural sites such as La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora La Reina de Los Ángeles and the Garnier Building, otherwise known as the Chinese American Museum, similarly tell the story of other historical groups of people that, like the Japanese, inhabited Downtown LA. While Downtown may not be the most aesthetically pleasing location to all, it is an important neighborhood rich in history that helps community members maintain a sense of belonging to LA. As a result, Downtown LA is a hub that supports the many cultures that comprise Los Angeles.
 In addition to various ethnic groups, Downtown LA is marked by its large homeless population that takes advantage of its public space to form community. Upon entering San Julian Street near 6th street, it is hard for visitors to ignore the “Skid Row Super Mural” created by activist General Jeff and Skid Row residents (Winston Death Squad).

The mural depicts a map with the strict boundaries of Skid Row as outlined in the Jones vs. the City of Los Angeles court case (Winston Death Squad). It also depicts Skid Row’s “official” sign with the city seal and a population reading “Too Many” (Winston Death Squad).  The mural not only takes a stab at LA’s inability to move the homeless move out of poverty, but also serves to physically define and unite its people. It demonstrates how the homeless of downtown LA have claimed their territory, developed a community around it, and are here to stay for the long term. 
 The creation of Skid Row is a result of the Industrial Age when cheap, small hotels and transitional living spaces popped up to accommodate the influx of workers but were later deemed unsafe. When many of these buildings were torn down, lower income residents were displaced and began residing in the streets. Today, “of the estimated 91,00 homeless people living in Los Angeles County, it is estimated that 2,521 homeless persons can be found within the .4 square miles of the Skid Row area. Those numbers equate to roughly 3% of the county’s entire homeless population residing within an area that comprises only .0001% of the county’s total land area” (Community Redevelopment Agency). As a result, the high density of homeless people in downtown LA has contributed to the formation of an inclusive community for these lower income LA residents. Common neighborhood activities include gathering at Glady’s Park, playing basketball and board games, and convening on the streets to converse, share art, and even share literature (Bacon). By engaging with each other, community members have established Skid Row as a neighborhood and take on a family like culture. Resident Linda Harris further explains, “People here accept you for who you are...Down here everyone is equal” (Bacon). Downtown LA therefore cultivates a sense of belonging to those who have been pushed out of LA and serves as an important shared space for lower income residents. 
 As an explanation for contemporary development, current demographics of Downtown LA differ wildly from the original makeup of diverse backgrounds and minority groups. Downtown LA formed as a melting pot of different races and culture; however, recent census data tells of a different story. Between 2010 and 2015, there was a 36% increase in the Caucasian makeup of Downtown LA while African American population fell by 17%. This reveals how as more white residents came into the neighborhood, the cultures that made up the original property were becoming less prominent. Former residents are unable to keep up with the rising neighborhood standards caused by this increase in Caucasian population and are being pushed out further from the city to less developed areas. As more white residents move into downtown, the cultural makeup, ranging from food to business to art, is being impacted. Even by simply touring downtown, one is able to notice the constant construction that takes place, renewing the old with less culturally accurate representations. The current demographics therefore reveal the new complexities being brought onto DTLA and serve as a physical contrast to how Downtown LA historically visually appeared.
