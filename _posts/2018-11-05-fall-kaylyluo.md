With an influx of contemporary shops, trendy restaurants, and modern apartments, newcomers willing to pay higher prices may unknowingly be working towards redeveloping a city. To those living in these “new” cities, these additional amenities benefit the affluent residents moving in. However, the price of taking a worn down city and revamping it to become a flourishing mecca goes beyond the costs of new buildings; it strips away generations of community that have either immigrated or built their foundations within the neighborhood. High rent prices and expensive shops displace locals who are unable to keep up with the hike in basic living costs and are forced out of these neighborhoods. These small neighborhoods become morphed to fit industry growth and begin to lose cultural identity as a result. This process is known as gentrification and waivers between being beneficial and controversial depending on whose experiencing it. Although it was originally a melting pot of coexisting cultures, Venice is currently leaning towards becoming a new technology hotspot called Silicon Beach, which suits a younger and more affluent millennial audience. For example, the Abbot Kinney Boulevard neighborhood first existed as a hub for small businesses to flourish but it is now leaning towards a ground for larger corporate shops. Oakwood, another small neighborhood within Venice, houses low income African Americans, but is under threat from city pressures to move to make space for technology industry employees. As Venice Beach is currently undergoing gentrification, this city’s history is are being lost and forgotten by the new structures and lose of its original people. Venice Beach’s future as a community will be based on the intertwining relationship of how both the locals and new residents are capable of interacting with each other. 
Venice is now becoming gentrified by larger corporations such as Google and Buzzfeed taking advantage of the new technology industry in Silicon Beach. Before, Venice Beach was known for its “eclectic mix of art studios, funky boutiques, junky antique stores and cheap restaurants, [now] it is instead a commercial real estate boom for a new demographic of wealthy locals” (Martin, 2017). Between Blue Bottle coffee shop and Rag and Bone, Abbot Kinney Boulevard houses some of the most luxurious amenities, turning it into a high end hangout for the wealthy. Named after the man who founded Venice, Abbot Kinney Boulevard has shifted away from its original founder’s vision as “a romantic and nostalgic community to the alternative lifestyle” (Moutout, 2017) to its current day state. While some may argue Venice still exists within the parameters of these morals, it is vastly contrasting its indigenous past. It was once a hidden gem, however, GQ marked Abbot Kinney as “the coolest block in America” (2012). In turn, exponentially shifting the streets away from quirky shops to a polished walkway.  Prospective profiteers in the area have slowly turned it into a target for new hotels and commercial space. Instead of finding mom and pop shops corporations raided the area by planting their offices around the corner. The influx of new properties and corporations have put a strain on the original culture that Abbot Kinney Boulevard was founded upon. This gentrification was brought on by one of the original developers of Abbot Kinney Boulevard, Kevin Brunk. He was responsible for spearheading the transition between what was once West Washington street to the new Abbot Kinney Boulevard. Originally, Brunk intended to revive the legacy of Abbot Kinney and beautify the neighborhood through planting trees and polishing the streets. Instead, he ended up seeding the way for developers to continue improvements through gentrification. Through this, Brunk catalyzed the route to gentrification and its fading culture. The new neighborhood attracts an inrush of new faces that “don’t appreciate or understand the history and culture that they are trampling” (Martin, 2017). The popularity of Abbot Kinney Boulevard has caused locals, who once thrived off the surf culture and cheap food, to no longer be able to afford the cost of living in Venice, one of them ironically being Brunk, the developer. This leaves room for a newer community to integrate their culture within Abbot Kinney Boulevard.

One of the major immigrant communities in Abbot Kinney Boulevard include the French, who have influenced the neighborhoods culture through opening schools and restaurants throughout the area. Adjacent to Blue Bottle, there is a mural around seven feet high that lines two sides of the block displaying colorful images of whimsical depictions   of animals. The words on the mural “vous voyez le monde comme les enfants se forment” come from a French children’s song roughly meaning “you see the world as children are forming” (“Claire Fontaine”, 2016) highlighting the significance a young generation holds. These children being brought up by the neighborhood school will continue to weave French and American culture, in turn, assimilating them into the changing Venice Beach environment. The large murals are a major delineation of the the divide between the affluent French community and the populating lower class community that is purposefully hidden from the rest of Venice Beach. These French communities have been integrating themselves into California since the 90s and have not faced backlash. Since the early 2000s, Abbot Kinney Boulevard has housed a dense French community that has cultivated an area where “if you wanted to, you could see only French doctors, eat only French food, and see only French music and films” (Reynolds, 2001).  Within the mile long strip, there are over ten French dining options that range from anywhere between cheap comfort foods to traditional elegant meals. The sheer number of French facilities that are concentrated within this area delineate that the French and the newer neighbors are adapting smoothly to each other. In comparison to the lower class locals in Oakwood, the French are better capable of assimilating into the newly gentrified neighborhood because their culture is more widely accepted.
	The relationship between the Oakwood neighborhood and Abbot Kinney Boulevard neighborhood is best captivated by the relationship of Irving Tabor and Abbot Kinney himself. In the early 1900s, Irving Tabor was one of the original Oakwood homeowners and the chauffeur of Abbot Kinney. Tabor was originally a janitor at one of the beach piers, however, one day Kinney saw him working hard and on impulse hired him as his driver. Through being his driver, Irving developed a close bond to Abbot Kinney that most would describe as “special.”  Thelma Tabing Brawly, Irving Tabor’s daughter, revealed that “‘Daddy drove Mr. Kinney all over the United States. Wherever Mr. Kinney had to go, daddy would be there with him. And Mr. Kinney refused to stay in any hotel that would not take daddy” (Sullivan, 1990). Although the families were close, Abbot Kinney’s egalitarianism towards the family was regarded as distasteful. During this period, Caucasians within the community felt that only whites were allowed to reside on the banks of Venice Beach canals and boardwalk, despite the labor African Americans provided building the land. Since the Tabor’s were African American in a period of racial segregation, they were pushed out of the estates near the boardwalk when Abbot Kinney passed. Irving Tabor's relocation had become the starting point for the remnants of the current Oakwood community. The presence of African Americans in building Venice Beach play in integral role in the current day divide between the two coexisting communities of affluent Caucasians and low income African Americans. 
Oakwood is a small one square mile cluster hidden from tourists with a majority African American community that is changing demographically. Divided by two subcultures within less than a mile apart, Abbot Kinney Boulevard and the Oakwood community characterizes both the upper and lower class of Los Angeles through its people and culture. Low income locals are being pushed further into Oakwood or out of Venice Beach completely by wealthy immigrants looking to capitalize on Venice’s “cheaper” real estate. Within a half mile radius there is a clear juxtaposition of these two neighborhoods based on the infrastructure. In the last decade, high end retail stores in Abbot Kinney boulevard have been created to draw attention away from the nearby gated elementary schools and rundown parks in Oakwood. In the 1980’s the African American population in Venice Beach, according to census, was at a 9.8%; now, the population has dropped to 5.4% (Carroll, 2016). The decline in African Americans directly correlate to the high estate prices and lingering racial discrimination. While some African Americans have already sold their properties for high prices, those who stay face harassment and discrimination from the booming tech industry and city officials consistently. Current “members of Oakwood’s dwindling population of color allege police use the injunction extensive powers to harass them,” leaving many members to stay hidden in their homes (Carroll, 2016). Oakwood, before gentrification, has long been stereotyped by its prior gang violence and crime rates. In one instance, an African American man was detained for wearing a hoodie and greeting a friend while a group of Caucasians “road bikes without lights and walked dogs off leashes, trivial-seeming violations that underlined racial inequity” (Carroll, 2016). As a result, this preconceived notion of Venice being filled with dangerous profiles still persists and is displayed by how others in the community interact to Oakwood residents. This lack of equality in terms of law reinforcement demonstrates that there is cleary racial discrimination within Venice Beach. Discrimination from neighbors by officials are increasingly based on the pressure companies surrounding have instilled upon the community. 
As new corporations spill in, similar to Abbot Kinney, the neighborhood has undergone major reconstructions to landmarks that have disrupt the lifestyle of its residents. During times of high violence and racial tension, the Oakwood community had one safe haven: the First Baptist Church. Since, “there was nowhere else blacks could go. They couldn’t cross Lincoln. They couldn’t cross Washington,” the church became a symbol of congregation for Oakwood  (Schneider, 2018). However, the church is on the verge of turning into a new estate for Jay Penske, CEO of Penske Media Corporation; he wants to build his mansion on this property to capitalize on it’s large land area and Venice Beach location. Although Jay Penske faces backlash from the Oakwood community, the city lacks regard to preserve the history of those who helped provide the labor for Venice and has ceased to take action. The African American community are fighting to protect the land for fear of what Jay Penske’s 11,760 square-foot single-family home would cause in the neighborhood. The house threatens to strip away the culture that founded Venice Beach and is seen a possible catalyst for similar high end buildings to continue conglomerating around the area. Although the African American community is recognized by Venice Beach, they lack representation despite being an integral part of Venice Beach history. While some officials verbally acknowledge and have officially preserved some buildings, it does not account for the injustice for concern with the community as a whole. Currently, there is still a divided notion between commissioners regarding whether the church should become a historical monument and is going up for re vote in the next city poll. However, considering the persistence of outsiders to profit off all the land in Venice, regardless of the vote, there will be a continual fight with the Los Angeles County regarding the preservation of history. 
	As a part of Los Angeles County, Venice Beach’s future is plagued with the same problems facing other cities within Los Angeles and is struggling with finding an intermediate between a cultural hub or a top tourist destination. Originally, Venice Beach’s residents were counterculture artists and immigrants but they are being threatened by the city's incapability to support majority of these people economically. In Venice Beach’s current state, profit is driving the current cities decisions and future and the two communities Abbot Kinney Boulevard and Oakwood are affected on different scales. The change impacts the minority communities negatively since the cost of living is unmanageable forcing them to find homage in other locations. The current model of Venice beach “excludes long-time, lower-income residents who define the new neighborhood identity as an inauthentic version of Venice community life” because they are unable to build affordable housing (Deener, 2017). Similar to other cities in Los Angeles, it is taxing for the cities within the county to build affordable housing since the area is hostile to development. On average starting housing costs 500,000 dollars, which is not sustainable for a family earning 60,000 dollars a year. Although the city should focus on reconciling the community balance, the influx of the technology community is shifting it otherwise. 
Companies like Bird are changing the landscape and drawing in millennials with enticing jobs on the new commercial landscape of Venice Beach. Currently, the majority of the population in Venice Beach ranges between the ages of 19-35 years old (“Census profile”, 2016). These millennials are shifting Venice Beach away from its anti corporate culture. The introduction of millennial influence directly parallels the introduction of new stores and urban innovations embedded in the streets. Plaguing the streets of Venice, Bird electric scooters serve as a form of transportation that “works closely with the cities in which it operates so that Bird is a reliable and affordable transportation option for people who live and work there” (“Bird unveils”, 2017). As a modern day technological feature, these scooters symbolize the advancement of Venice Beach and its correlation as a technology start up city. Since Bird has placed its headquarters directly in Venice Beach, there have been ten million Birds implemented throughout the country. This phenomena of success draws in other companies and generates a domino effect for other startups to follow into the city. These trendy and innovative amenities can account for the inability for the Oakwood immigrant community due to adapt due to the generational gap of understanding. Compared to the Abbot Kinney Boulevard immigrant community, the Oakwood community is lower income and faces discrimination based on prior homeless and crime issues making it more challenging to assimilate. As a juxtaposition, the Abbot Kinney Boulevard community ceases to face this adversity because they lack segregation and offer an accent of their European culture that fits Venice Beach’s current presence facade. The medley of how the French, African American, and millennial communities interact moving forward will determine the transformation of Venice Beach.
As gentrification of Venice Beach continues to penetrate the city, a revolution of culture will follow as well. The innate goal of revamping Venice Beach was to lessen the gang violence rate and turn it into a tourist attraction. In turn, gentrification has displaced local communities shifting it from a cultural hub to a technology ridden city. Inevitably, with the gentrification of Venice the prices will increase resulting in loss of cultures and change of landscape. While gentrification has offered a means to redevelop Venice Beach into a start-up technology, it has buried some of the culture as a result. While some communities are able to assimilate and keep pace with the inauguration of Millennials from these technology start ups, others are left unable to keep pace with the raising rent prices forcing them to move further inland or out of state. The culture that founded Venice Beach was filled with an array of diversity ranging from liberal artists and die hard surf fanatics has slowly faded as years past. Now, the culture of Venice Beach will continue to mold into another direction as it works to mesh together new and old to form the future of the city.
